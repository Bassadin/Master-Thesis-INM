# Master-Thesis-INM

My master's thesis in Computer Science during Summer Semester 2023 about Localization in LoRa-based networks.
The repo will get updated during the semester.

## LaTeX

The LaTeX source code is located in the `thesis` folder.

## Knowledgebase

The knowledgebase is located in the `knowledgebase_obsidian` folder.
The markdown (`.md`) files can be viewed in any editor, but the best experience is achieved with [Obsidian.md]([C:\Users\basti\Documents\Git-Repos\Master-Thesis-INM\knowledgebase_obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)).
