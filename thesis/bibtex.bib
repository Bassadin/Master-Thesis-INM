	abstract = {Positioning is an essential element in most Internet of Things ({IoT}) applications. Global Positioning System ({GPS}) chips have high cost and power consumption, making it unsuitable for long-range ({LoRa}) and low-power {IoT} devices. Alternatively, low-power wide-area ({LPWA}) signals can be used for simultaneous positioning and communication. We summarize previous studies related to {LoRa} signal-based positioning systems, including those addressing proximity, a path loss model, time difference of arrival ({TDoA}), and fingerprint positioning methods. We propose a {LoRa} signal-based positioning method that uses a fingerprint algorithm instead of a received signal strength indicator ({RSSI}) proximity or {TDoA} method. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the accuracy and usability of the fingerprint algorithm for large areas in the real world. We estimated the locations using probabilistic means based on three different algorithms that use interpolated fingerprint {RSSI} maps. The average accuracy of the three proposed algorithms in our experiments was 28.8 m. Our method also reduced the battery consumption significantly compared with that of existing {GPS}-based positioning methods.},

	abstract = {Low-power wide-area network ({LPWAN}) technologies featuring long-range communication capability and low power consumption will be important for forming the Internet of Things ({IoT}) consisting of many geographically distributed objects. Among various appearing {LPWAN} technologies, {LoRa} has received the most research attention due to its open specifications and gateway infrastructures unlike the closed designs and/or managed gateway infrastructures of other {LPWAN} technologies. While existing studies on {LoRa} has focused on network connectivity and performance, accurate positioning of {LoRa} end devices is still largely an open issue. In this paper, we discuss and analyze the physical layer features of {LoRa} that are relevant to localization. Our discussions and analysis illustrate the opportunities and challenges in implementing {LoRa}-based localization.},
