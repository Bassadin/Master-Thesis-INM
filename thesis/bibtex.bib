	abstract = {The {IoT} contains billions of interconnected devices and is only growing larger by the day. These devices often need to operate for years while keeping mobile objects, such as animals or vehicles, connected to a larger system. Therefore they will be battery-powered, energy efficient and, their position will be tracked. Therefore, connecting these devices requires low-power, long-range communication that can also be used for localisation. Because of the scale of the {IoT} industry, manufacturing and infrastructure costs need to be considered. The low cost, long range and energy efficiency that is required exempts many wireless communication and localisation solutions such as {WiFi}, {GPS} and Bluetooth because they are not as suitable as {LowPower} Wide-Area Networks ({LPWAN}’s). {LoRa} is a {LPWAN} technology that is both Long-Range and cost effective. Therefore, the objective of this thesis is to use a {LoRa} network for our localisation algorithms. In this work we show that signal strength data becomes turbulent when communicating over a large, urban area. Therefore we evaluate Time Difference of Arrival ({TDoA})-based localisation algorithms, including a novel area-based algorithm that we developed. We evaluate the localisation algorithms on a proprietary {LoRa} network which also provides a localisation service that we use as a benchmark. We evaluate the performance of the algorithms over a large, mostly urban, region of The Netherlands. Using mobile {LoRa} devices, we show that for 80\% of cases, our proposed algorithm has a position error less than 925m. We also show that the other localisation methods, including the proprietary localisation service, have a larger maximum position error for the same portion of cases. This work contributes a localisation algorithm that can compete against proprietary geolocation services, such as Sigfox and {KPN}’s services, in many applications.},

	abstract = {Low-power wide-area network ({LPWAN}) technologies featuring long-range communication capability and low power consumption will be important for forming the Internet of Things ({IoT}) consisting of many geographically distributed objects. Among various appearing {LPWAN} technologies, {LoRa} has received the most research attention due to its open specifications and gateway infrastructures unlike the closed designs and/or managed gateway infrastructures of other {LPWAN} technologies. While existing studies on {LoRa} has focused on network connectivity and performance, accurate positioning of {LoRa} end devices is still largely an open issue. In this paper, we discuss and analyze the physical layer features of {LoRa} that are relevant to localization. Our discussions and analysis illustrate the opportunities and challenges in implementing {LoRa}-based localization.},

	abstract = {Positioning is an essential element in most Internet of Things ({IoT}) applications. Global Positioning System ({GPS}) chips have high cost and power consumption, making it unsuitable for long-range ({LoRa}) and low-power {IoT} devices. Alternatively, low-power wide-area ({LPWA}) signals can be used for simultaneous positioning and communication. We summarize previous studies related to {LoRa} signal-based positioning systems, including those addressing proximity, a path loss model, time difference of arrival ({TDoA}), and fingerprint positioning methods. We propose a {LoRa} signal-based positioning method that uses a fingerprint algorithm instead of a received signal strength indicator ({RSSI}) proximity or {TDoA} method. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the accuracy and usability of the fingerprint algorithm for large areas in the real world. We estimated the locations using probabilistic means based on three different algorithms that use interpolated fingerprint {RSSI} maps. The average accuracy of the three proposed algorithms in our experiments was 28.8 m. Our method also reduced the battery consumption significantly compared with that of existing {GPS}-based positioning methods.},

While extending the range of communication links, the ability to provide large scale location-based services ({LBS}) solutions using native physical layer parameters from {IoT} networks will dramatically widen the availability of {IoT} applications. This letter proposes an enhanced Gaussian process-based localization solution for such a low power wide area network ({LPWAN}). It effectively deals with intermittent signals over a large area caused by low communication throughput, interference or packet collisions in {LPWAN}. Furthermore, a parametric model enhancement combining indoor and outdoor hypotheses and signal propagation statistics is proposed and evaluated. Field tests over a 37,500 square meter area have been conducted. Results show that the proposed method can provide {LBS}-quality positioning with a 2-D root mean square error of 20 to 30 meters, with an accuracy improvement of 29.8\% outdoors and 40.6\% indoors, respectively, compared to the traditional fingerprinting method.},

	abstract = {Because of the increasing relevance of the Internet of Things and location-based services, researchers are evaluating wireless positioning techniques, such as fingerprinting, on Low Power Wide Area Network ({LPWAN}) communication. In order to evaluate fingerprinting in large outdoor environments, extensive, time-consuming measurement campaigns need to be conducted to create useful datasets. This paper presents three {LPWAN} datasets which are collected in large-scale urban and rural areas. The goal is to provide the research community with a tool to evaluate fingerprinting algorithms in large outdoor environments. During a period of three months, numerous mobile devices periodically obtained location data via a {GPS} receiver which was transmitted via a Sigfox or {LoRaWAN} message. Together with network information, this location data is stored in the appropriate {LPWAN} dataset. The first results of our basic fingerprinting implementation, which is also clarified in this paper, indicate a mean location estimation error of 214.58 m for the rural Sigfox dataset, 688.97 m for the urban Sigfox dataset and 398.40 m for the urban {LoRaWAN} dataset. In the future, we will enlarge our current datasets and use them to evaluate and optimize our fingerprinting methods. Also, we intend to collect additional datasets for Sigfox, {LoRaWAN} and {NB}-{IoT}.},

	abstract = {The vision of tracking small {IoT} devices runs into the reality of localization technologies --- today it is difficult to continuously track objects through walls in homes and warehouses on a coin cell battery. While Wi-Fi and ultra-wideband radios can provide tracking through walls, they do not last more than a month on small coin and button cell batteries since they consume tens of milliwatts of power. We present the first localization system that consumes microwatts of power at a mobile device and can be localized across multiple rooms in settings like homes and hospitals. To this end, we introduce a multi-band backscatter prototype that operates across 900 {MHz}, 2.4 and 5 {GHz} and can extract the backscatter phase information from signals that are below the noise floor. We build sub-centimeter sized prototypes which consume 93 μW and could last five to ten years on button cell batteries. We achieved ranges of up to 60 m away from the {AP} and accuracies of 2, 12, 50 and 145 cm at 1, 5, 30 and 60 m respectively. To demonstrate the potential of our design, we deploy it in two real-world scenarios: five homes in a metropolitan area and the surgery wing of a hospital in patient pre-op and post-op rooms as well as storage facilities.},

	abstract = {Smart farms and {IoT} (Internet of Things) have an inseparable relationship. Sensors, gateways, servers, databases, web-based applications, are all widely used by connected smart farms. Also, the range of communication availability, the amount of power required for communication, and required equipment are differs depending on the networking technology. Hence, the decision of networking technology is very important when implementing a smart farm. While there are many networking technologies, {LoRa} (Long Range) is one of the most common Low Power Wide Area Network ({LPWAN}) in use by smart farms in the United States. Theoretically, {APRS} (Automatic Packet Reporting System) can communicate at greater distances than {LoRa}. Therefore, the study compares the feasibility of {LoRa} and {APRS} in smart farms by measuring the distance coverage of the two networking technologies. All three tests were conducted at the Purdue Agronomy Center for Research and Education where the transmitting antennas were mobile that moved via cars, and the receiving antennas were installed at the same tower. The distances were calculated by using Google Maps, where all the locations for the transmitting points were saved. From evaluating the test results, this paper concludes that {LoRa} is a more feasible wireless connection than {APRS} in the smart farm {IoT} system.},
