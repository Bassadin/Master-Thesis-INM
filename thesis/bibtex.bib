  abstract = {Because of the increasing relevance of the Internet of Things and location-based services, researchers are evaluating wireless positioning techniques, such as fingerprinting, on Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) communication. In order to evaluate fingerprinting in large outdoor environments, extensive, time-consuming measurement campaigns need to be conducted to create useful datasets. This paper presents three LPWAN datasets which are collected in large-scale urban and rural areas. The goal is to provide the research community with a tool to evaluate fingerprinting algorithms in large outdoor environments. During a period of three months, numerous mobile devices periodically obtained location data via a GPS receiver which was transmitted via a Sigfox or LoRaWAN message. Together with network information, this location data is stored in the appropriate LPWAN dataset. The first results of our basic fingerprinting implementation, which is also clarified in this paper, indicate a mean location estimation error of 214.58 m for the rural Sigfox dataset, 688.97 m for the urban Sigfox dataset and 398.40 m for the urban LoRaWAN dataset. In the future, we will enlarge our current datasets and use them to evaluate and optimize our fingerprinting methods. Also, we intend to collect additional datasets for Sigfox, LoRaWAN and NB-IoT.},

  abstract = {In the recent years the Location Based Services (LBS) are grabbing the attention of telecommunication actors since they are sources of new services and new revenues. The main challenge in the LBS domain is the localization of the mobile terminals within a certain accuracy. To this end, several radio positioning techniques have been introduced, one of which is the Location Fingerprinting. Although location fingerprinting has been investigated in some previous works, however there are only few studies that analyze its performance according to physical parameters of the underlying environment. In this paper, we present a performance analysis of the outdoor location fingerprinting systems. We propose a radio propagation model which allows us to introduce some spatial correlations for the shadowing effect and to include the temporal fluctuations of the radio signal. Based on our model, we examine the impact of different physical parameters on the system performance, and thereby we provide a framework which may be useful in the design and implementation of fingerprinting positioning systems.},

  abstract = {The IoT contains billions of interconnected devices and is only growing larger by the day. These devices often need to operate for years while keeping mobile objects, such as animals or vehicles, connected to a larger system. Therefore they will be battery-powered, energy efficient and, their position will be tracked. Therefore, connecting these devices requires low-power, long-range communication that can also be used for localisation. Because of the scale of the IoT industry, manufacturing and infrastructure costs need to be considered. The low cost, long range and energy efficiency that is required exempts many wireless communication and localisation solutions such as WiFi, GPS and Bluetooth because they are not as suitable as LowPower Wide-Area Networks (LPWAN’s). LoRa is a LPWAN technology that is both Long-Range and cost effective. Therefore, the objective of this thesis is to use a LoRa network for our localisation algorithms. In this work we show that signal strength data becomes turbulent when communicating over a large, urban area. Therefore we evaluate Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA)-based localisation algorithms, including a novel area-based algorithm that we developed. We evaluate the localisation algorithms on a proprietary LoRa network which also provides a localisation service that we use as a benchmark. We evaluate the performance of the algorithms over a large, mostly urban, region of The Netherlands. Using mobile LoRa devices, we show that for 80\% of cases, our proposed algorithm has a position error less than 925m. We also show that the other localisation methods, including the proprietary localisation service, have a larger maximum position error for the same portion of cases. This work contributes a localisation algorithm that can compete against proprietary geolocation services, such as Sigfox and KPN’s services, in many applications.},

A promising technology to achieve the low-power and long-range requirements is seen in LoRaWAN, a media access control (MAC) protocol maintained by the LoRa Alliance and leveraging Semtech's patented LoRa radio modulation technology. LoRaWAN provides three different device classes (A, B and C), which provide a tradeoff between performance (i.e., throughput and latency) and energy consumption. This paper offers a theoretical and experimental comparison of these classes. The objective of the quantitative experiment was twofold: to verify the published current levels of different operating modes in a LoRa chip's datasheet and to compare the battery lifetime for the LoRa class A and C modes of operation. We used a high-end current sensing circuit to gather the voltage levels and temporal variation with increasing payload sizes and spreading factors. Using the Ohmic Law, the energy drain can be calculated and compared across the different spreading factors (SF) and classes.},

Global Positioning System (GPS) chips have high cost and power consumption, making it unsuitable for long-range (LoRa) and low-power IoT devices. Alternatively, low-power wide-area (LPWA) signals can be used for simultaneous positioning and communication. We summarize previous studies related to LoRa signal-based positioning systems, including those addressing proximity, a path loss model, time difference of arrival (TDoA), and fingerprint positioning methods. We propose a LoRa signal-based positioning method that uses a fingerprint algorithm instead of a received signal strength indicator (RSSI) proximity or TDoA method. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the accuracy and usability of the fingerprint algorithm for large areas in the real world. We estimated the locations using probabilistic means based on three different algorithms that use interpolated fingerprint RSSI maps. The average accuracy of the three proposed algorithms in our experiments was 28.8 m. Our method also reduced the battery consumption significantly compared with that of existing GPS-based positioning methods.},

We found that using commodity 802.11 technology over a range of algorithms, approaches and environments, one can expect a median localization error of 10 ft and 97th percentile of 30 ft.

  abstract = {With the recent advances of technology innovation in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) era, radio chips are able to transmit over long distances with extremely low energy consumption. While extending the range of communication links, the ability to provide large scale location-based services (LBS) solutions using native physical layer parameters from IoT networks will dramatically widen the availability of IoT applications. This letter proposes an enhanced Gaussian process-based localization solution for such a low power wide area network (LPWAN). It effectively deals with intermittent signals over a large area caused by low communication throughput, interference or packet collisions in LPWAN. Furthermore, a parametric model enhancement combining indoor and outdoor hypotheses and signal propagation statistics is proposed and evaluated. Field tests over a 37,500 square meter area have been conducted. Results show that the proposed method can provide LBS-quality positioning with a 2-D root mean square error of 20 to 30 meters, with an accuracy improvement of 29.8\% outdoors and 40.6\% indoors, respectively, compared to the traditional fingerprinting method.},

  abstract = {Smart farms and IoT (Internet of Things) have an inseparable relationship. Sensors, gateways, servers, databases, web-based applications, are all widely used by connected smart farms. Also, the range of communication availability, the amount of power required for communication, and required equipment are differs depending on the networking technology. Hence, the decision of networking technology is very important when implementing a smart farm. While there are many networking technologies, LoRa (Long Range) is one of the most common Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) in use by smart farms in the United States. Theoretically, APRS (Automatic Packet Reporting System) can communicate at greater distances than LoRa. Therefore, the study compares the feasibility of LoRa and APRS in smart farms by measuring the distance coverage of the two networking technologies. All three tests were conducted at the Purdue Agronomy Center for Research and Education where the transmitting antennas were mobile that moved via cars, and the receiving antennas were installed at the same tower. The distances were calculated by using Google Maps, where all the locations for the transmitting points were saved. From evaluating the test results, this paper concludes that LoRa is a more feasible wireless connection than APRS in the smart farm IoT system.},

It is a key technology in building a Low-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) because it provides reliable low-power data transmission. An essential point and challenge in the application of this technology is ensuring maximum autonomy of LoRaWAN end devices by achieving the lowest possible energy consumption in sleep and active mode and the search for efficient power supply solutions. In this paper, a solution for autonomous powering of a LoRaWAN end device with a photovoltaic panel and optimization of energy consumption in different operating modes is proposed and investigated.

While Wi-Fi and ultra-wideband radios can provide tracking through walls, they do not last more than a month on small coin and button cell batteries since they consume tens of milliwatts of power. We present the first localization system that consumes microwatts of power at a mobile device and can be localized across multiple rooms in settings like homes and hospitals. To this end, we introduce a multi-band backscatter prototype that operates across 900 MHz, 2.4 and 5 GHz and can extract the backscatter phase information from signals that are below the noise floor. We build sub-centimeter sized prototypes which consume 93 μW and could last five to ten years on button cell batteries. We achieved ranges of up to 60 m away from the AP and accuracies of 2, 12, 50 and 145 cm at 1, 5, 30 and 60 m respectively. To demonstrate the potential of our design, we deploy it in two real-world scenarios: five homes in a metropolitan area and the surgery wing of a hospital in patient pre-op and post-op rooms as well as storage facilities.},

However, for environment with many obstacles and blind spots, the classical star network has limitation in area coverage. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the LoRaWAN extender using multiple relays in terms of coverage ability, performance, and power consumption. In this research, the design and implementation of a multiple relay system compatible with the LoRaWAN protocol is studied to extend the coverage of a classical LoRaWAN gateway. The relay can have multiple years of operation with a compact battery. These relays were deployed along a deep river will complex terrain that the gateway can not fully cover. The longest distance of each relay was recorded so that the packets sent by the previous relay were still received by the next relay, the packet loss ratio and latency were calculated to evaluate the performance, and power consumption was measured by using a power analyzer. The results show the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed design for multiple relays to extend the LoRaWAN network.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the study of the various factors of LoRaWAN or LPWAN (Low power wide area network), that affect energy consumption compared to the efficiency of sensor nodes such as the transmitting and receiving data, the distance of transmission, and stability. The experiment efficiency of sensor node system by focuses on two parts. The first part, considered the node's communication. We connected sensor node 3 nodes with LoRa base station and operating communication test for 7 days using the sensor node, which purpose to measurement and monitor of soil moisture, temperature, and humidity. Then setting and varying 3 communication parameters namely such as SF (spreading factor), CR (coding rate), d (distance). When any variable is adjusted, other variable is remaining constant. Finally, energy consumption was analyzed with each of variable to determine the suitability for different environments. When SF is high the power consumption is high, which is the highest SF value is 11. When the CR is low the power consumption is high, the lowest CR is 4/8. The second part, we measuring factor of packet's communication, which is following to the LoRa protocol standard. Which the power consumption 73.29 mW/H. From experiment test, the soil moisture sensor nodes have a battery node's lifetime is 6 days and 3 hours. in addition, maximum distance to communication of the soil moisture sensor node is 226 m, with RSSI -116 dBm.},

  abstract = {Now a day, appropriate and correct indoor positioning in wireless networks could provide interesting services and applications. However, there are more factors of the indoor environment caused to reduce the precise localization and also increase the error of distance. This paper presents a new method to evaluate the wireless sensor network (WSN) technology for the indoor localization. The weighting algorithms: the weight range localizer (WRL) and relative span exponential weight range localizer (RS-WRL) are using based on received signal strength indicator (RSSI) to estimate the position of target node. As the results, the cumulative distribution function (CDF) probability indicates the error of distance as properly, and this method can help to increase the precision of range based localization method in an application of indoor environment.},
