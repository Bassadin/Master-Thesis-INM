  abstract = {LoRa/LoRaWAN enables long-range links, which result in anisotropic propagation around the gateway as the links are likely to experience different environments. This property is not captured by popular distance based channel models, which makes them inaccurate to estimate LoRaWAN coverage. An alternative is conducting a site survey to build a path loss model, however, despite the many published LoRaWAN site surveys there is no accepted survey methodology. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a well-defined methodology that specifies how to plan and execute a site-survey for LoRa/LoRaWAN. Several disjoint survey paths are explored simultaneously to capture the high spatial variations of LoRaWAN coverage. The proposed methodology was examined in a small, hilly, town in rural Ireland and the measurements were fitted in both a single and dual component (near and far) log-distance path loss model, the latter being more accurate. We also investigated the impact of terrain elevation on the path loss and packet delivery rate, the impact of multipath reflection, and the variation in link quality from indoor and outdoor transmissions. Finally, using the collected measurements, we evaluated how increasing the number of survey paths affects the accuracy of the resulting channel model.},

  abstract = {With the growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), it is critical to understand the packet transmission performance in Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN), especially LoRaWAN. Previous works on LoRaWAN network performance analysis, either simulation-based or field measurement, are considering the Packet Delivery Rate (PDR) as a major measure of the network performance and its dependency on the signal impairments. However, the Effective Signal Power (ESP) and its huge variability along with the different frequency bands, for each location, are not generally considered. In this paper, an in-depth investigation of the frequency dependency of the PDR is done by performing an outdoor measurement campaign in the area of the Campus Beaulieu in Rennes. From each different location, the ESP and SINR (Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio) values are obtained as well as the influence of these parameters on the PDR is evaluated at each frequency band independently. In the given results, the feasibility of using the ESP is proven by its enlarged range when the SINR is very low, unlike the RSSI which has a limitation. This investigation manifests and gives important guidelines for using ESP in the future IoT applications.},

  abstract = {Because of the increasing relevance of the Internet of Things and location-based services, researchers are evaluating wireless positioning techniques, such as fingerprinting, on Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) communication. In order to evaluate fingerprinting in large outdoor environments, extensive, time-consuming measurement campaigns need to be conducted to create useful datasets. This paper presents three LPWAN datasets which are collected in large-scale urban and rural areas. The goal is to provide the research community with a tool to evaluate fingerprinting algorithms in large outdoor environments. During a period of three months, numerous mobile devices periodically obtained location data via a GPS receiver which was transmitted via a Sigfox or LoRaWAN message. Together with network information, this location data is stored in the appropriate LPWAN dataset. The first results of our basic fingerprinting implementation, which is also clarified in this paper, indicate a mean location estimation error of 214.58 m for the rural Sigfox dataset, 688.97 m for the urban Sigfox dataset and 398.40 m for the urban LoRaWAN dataset. In the future, we will enlarge our current datasets and use them to evaluate and optimize our fingerprinting methods. Also, we intend to collect additional datasets for Sigfox, LoRaWAN and NB-IoT.},

The main challenge in the LBS domain is the localization of the mobile terminals within a certain accuracy. To this end, several radio positioning techniques have been introduced, one of which is the Location Fingerprinting. Although location fingerprinting has been investigated in some previous works, however there are only few studies that analyze its performance according to physical parameters of the underlying environment. In this paper, we present a performance analysis of the outdoor location fingerprinting systems. We propose a radio propagation model which allows us to introduce some spatial correlations for the shadowing effect and to include the temporal fluctuations of the radio signal. Based on our model, we examine the impact of different physical parameters on the system performance, and thereby we provide a framework which may be useful in the design and implementation of fingerprinting positioning systems.},

  abstract = {LoRa is a popular Low-Power Wide-Area Networking (LP-WAN) technology that allows devices powered by a ten year AA battery to connect to radio infrastructure miles away. One of the most promising features of LoRa is the ability to track the location of radios from a distance, enabling applications ranging from inventory tracking, smart infrastructure monitoring and structural health sensing. Yet, state-of-the-art LoRa localization systems experience errors of several tens or even hundreds of meters in location tracking, owing to the narrow bandwidth and limited battery life of LoRa devices. This paper presents OwLL, a LoRa localization system that limits location error to few meters with commodity LoRa clients in a wide-area network. Our key innovation is the development of a distributed base station network made of individually low-cost components that together span a wide bandwidth that encompasses the TV whitespaces and offers high aperture, crucial to localization accuracy. We demonstrate how this network can aggregate signal measurements made across multiple different narrowband channels of a LoRa client to triangulate it at fine accuracy. We implement and evaluate OwLL on a testbed spanning a large university campus centered in a major U.S. city and demonstrate a 9 m (across line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight) median error in localization.},

  abstract = {The IoT contains billions of interconnected devices and is only growing larger by the day. These devices often need to operate for years while keeping mobile objects, such as animals or vehicles, connected to a larger system. Therefore they will be battery-powered, energy efficient and, their position will be tracked. Therefore, connecting these devices requires low-power, long-range communication that can also be used for localisation. Because of the scale of the IoT industry, manufacturing and infrastructure costs need to be considered. The low cost, long range and energy efficiency that is required exempts many wireless communication and localisation solutions such as WiFi, GPS and Bluetooth because they are not as suitable as LowPower Wide-Area Networks (LPWAN’s). LoRa is a LPWAN technology that is both Long-Range and cost effective. Therefore, the objective of this thesis is to use a LoRa network for our localisation algorithms. In this work we show that signal strength data becomes turbulent when communicating over a large, urban area. Therefore we evaluate Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA)-based localisation algorithms, including a novel area-based algorithm that we developed. We evaluate the localisation algorithms on a proprietary LoRa network which also provides a localisation service that we use as a benchmark. We evaluate the performance of the algorithms over a large, mostly urban, region of The Netherlands. Using mobile LoRa devices, we show that for 80\% of cases, our proposed algorithm has a position error less than 925m. We also show that the other localisation methods, including the proprietary localisation service, have a larger maximum position error for the same portion of cases. This work contributes a localisation algorithm that can compete against proprietary geolocation services, such as Sigfox and KPN’s services, in many applications.},

WideSee utilizes the LoRa signal to achieve a larger range of sensing and further incorporates drone's mobility to broaden the sensing area. WideSee presents solutions across software and hardware to overcome two aspects of challenges for wide-range contactless sensing: (i) the interference brought by the device mobility and LoRa's high sensitivity; and (ii) the ambiguous target information such as location when employing just a single pair of transceivers. We have developed a working prototype of WideSee for human target detection and localization that are especially useful in emergency scenarios such as rescue search, and evaluated WideSee with both controlled experiments and the field study in a high-rise building. Extensive experiments demonstrate the great potential of WideSee for wide-area contactless sensing with a single LoRa transceiver pair hosted on a drone.},

A promising technology to achieve the low-power and long-range requirements is seen in LoRaWAN, a media access control (MAC) protocol maintained by the LoRa Alliance and leveraging Semtech's patented LoRa radio modulation technology. LoRaWAN provides three different device classes (A, B and C), which provide a tradeoff between performance (i.e., throughput and latency) and energy consumption. This paper offers a theoretical and experimental comparison of these classes. The objective of the quantitative experiment was twofold: to verify the published current levels of different operating modes in a LoRa chip's datasheet and to compare the battery lifetime for the LoRa class A and C modes of operation. We used a high-end current sensing circuit to gather the voltage levels and temporal variation with increasing payload sizes and spreading factors.

We summarize previous studies related to LoRa signal-based positioning systems, including those addressing proximity, a path loss model, time difference of arrival (TDoA), and fingerprint positioning methods. We propose a LoRa signal-based positioning method that uses a fingerprint algorithm instead of a received signal strength indicator (RSSI) proximity or TDoA method. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the accuracy and usability of the fingerprint algorithm for large areas in the real world. We estimated the locations using probabilistic means based on three different algorithms that use interpolated fingerprint RSSI maps. The average accuracy of the three proposed algorithms in our experiments was 28.8 m. Our method also reduced the battery consumption significantly compared with that of existing GPS-based positioning methods.},

Signal strength approaches are attractive because they are widely applicable to wireless sensor networks and do not require additional localization hardware. We show that although a broad spectrum of algorithms can trade accuracy for precision, none has a significant advantage in localization performance. We found that using commodity 802.11 technology over a range of algorithms, approaches and environments, one can expect a median localization error of 10 ft and 97th percentile of 30 ft. We present strong evidence that these limitations are fundamental and that they are unlikely to transcend without a fundamentally more complex environmental models or additional localization infrastructure.},

LoRa uses Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) with different Spreading Factors (SF) to handle varying intensities of multipath reflections and interference. However, the standard LoRaWAN uses the pure ALOHA algorithm that suffers from both Intra-SF collisions and Inter-SF collisions which limit it to mostly low density environment. In this work, we optimize the transmission parameters of a LoRaWAN system in high density Smart City traffic environment using golden section search and parabolic interpolation. Our approach of optimum distribution of spreading factors not only significantly improves the success rate, but also enable more nodes to use lower spreading which results in lower delay.},

Ambient assisted living technologies can help in mitigating the need for continuous supervision, enabling the elderly to easily look for help in case of emergency. In this work, the well-known and widespread LoRaWAN communication infrastructure is evaluated for possible complementing indoor and outdoor positioning solutions, in order to alert a remotely-connected caregiver about accidents (e.g., falls). The choice of LoRaWAN is dictated by the capability to implement both private and public infrastructures. Satellite-based systems are addressed for outdoor localization, whereas the demanding task of indoor localization is solved by means of Ultra Wide Band technology. Results demonstrated sub-meter error in a typical indoor scenario, with average communication latency on the order of 700 ms.},

While extending the range of communication links, the ability to provide large scale location-based services (LBS) solutions using native physical layer parameters from IoT networks will dramatically widen the availability of IoT applications. This letter proposes an enhanced Gaussian process-based localization solution for such a low power wide area network (LPWAN). It effectively deals with intermittent signals over a large area caused by low communication throughput, interference or packet collisions in LPWAN. Furthermore, a parametric model enhancement combining indoor and outdoor hypotheses and signal propagation statistics is proposed and evaluated. Field tests over a 37,500 square meter area have been conducted. Results show that the proposed method can provide LBS-quality positioning with a 2-D root mean square error of 20 to 30 meters, with an accuracy improvement of 29.8\% outdoors and 40.6\% indoors, respectively, compared to the traditional fingerprinting method.},

Our work intents to evaluate the effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) as a deep learning technique to be implemented in this field. In addition, LSTM as a variant of RNN scheme is also implemented. The purpose of this implementation is to explore both LSTM and original RNN to be utilized for localization in indoor positioning scheme, especially for Wifi Fingerprinting Dataset.

However, a twofold ambiguity, usually of the vertical component, arises, which cannot be resolved without some prior knowledge about the general location of the object or an extra TOA measurement. The developed algorithm is simpler and faster than conventional ones, thus, complexity in terms of time, power consumption, and chip area is reduced.

The ability of low-cost long range (LoRa) radios for low-power and long-range communication has made this radio technology a suitable candidate for many indoor and outdoor IoT applications. Additionally, research studies have shown the feasibility of localization with LoRa radios. However, indoor localization with LoRa is not adequately explored at the home level, where the localization area is relatively smaller than offices and corporate buildings. In this study, we first explore the feasibility of ranging with LoRa. Then, we conduct experiments to demonstrate the capability of LoRa for accurate and precise indoor localization in a typical apartment setting. Our experimental results show that LoRa-based indoor localization has an accuracy better than 1.6 m in line-of-sight scenario and 3.2 m in extreme non-line-of-sight scenario with a precision better than 25 cm in all cases, without using any data filtering on the location estimates.},

  abstract = {Smart farms and IoT (Internet of Things) have an inseparable relationship. Sensors, gateways, servers, databases, web-based applications, are all widely used by connected smart farms. Also, the range of communication availability, the amount of power required for communication, and required equipment are differs depending on the networking technology. Hence, the decision of networking technology is very important when implementing a smart farm. While there are many networking technologies, LoRa (Long Range) is one of the most common Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) in use by smart farms in the United States. Theoretically, APRS (Automatic Packet Reporting System) can communicate at greater distances than LoRa. Therefore, the study compares the feasibility of LoRa and APRS in smart farms by measuring the distance coverage of the two networking technologies. All three tests were conducted at the Purdue Agronomy Center for Research and Education where the transmitting antennas were mobile that moved via cars, and the receiving antennas were installed at the same tower. The distances were calculated by using Google Maps, where all the locations for the transmitting points were saved. From evaluating the test results, this paper concludes that LoRa is a more feasible wireless connection than APRS in the smart farm IoT system.},

An essential point and challenge in the application of this technology is ensuring maximum autonomy of LoRaWAN end devices by achieving the lowest possible energy consumption in sleep and active mode and the search for efficient power supply solutions. In this paper, a solution for autonomous powering of a LoRaWAN end device with a photovoltaic panel and optimization of energy consumption in different operating modes is proposed and investigated.

While Wi-Fi and ultra-wideband radios can provide tracking through walls, they do not last more than a month on small coin and button cell batteries since they consume tens of milliwatts of power. We present the first localization system that consumes microwatts of power at a mobile device and can be localized across multiple rooms in settings like homes and hospitals. To this end, we introduce a multi-band backscatter prototype that operates across 900 MHz, 2.4 and 5 GHz and can extract the backscatter phase information from signals that are below the noise floor. We build sub-centimeter sized prototypes which consume 93 μW and could last five to ten years on button cell batteries. We achieved ranges of up to 60 m away from the AP and accuracies of 2, 12, 50 and 145 cm at 1, 5, 30 and 60 m respectively. To demonstrate the potential of our design, we deploy it in two real-world scenarios: five homes in a metropolitan area and the surgery wing of a hospital in patient pre-op and post-op rooms as well as storage facilities.},

However, for environment with many obstacles and blind spots, the classical star network has limitation in area coverage. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the LoRaWAN extender using multiple relays in terms of coverage ability, performance, and power consumption. In this research, the design and implementation of a multiple relay system compatible with the LoRaWAN protocol is studied to extend the coverage of a classical LoRaWAN gateway. The relay can have multiple years of operation with a compact battery. These relays were deployed along a deep river will complex terrain that the gateway can not fully cover. The longest distance of each relay was recorded so that the packets sent by the previous relay were still received by the next relay, the packet loss ratio and latency were calculated to evaluate the performance, and power consumption was measured by using a power analyzer. The results show the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed design for multiple relays to extend the LoRaWAN network.},

  abstract = {The growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) continues to be rapid, making it an essential part of information technology. As a result, IoT devices must be able to handle data collection, machine-to-machine (M2M) communication, and preprocessing of data, while also considering cost, processing power, and energy consumption. This paper introduces a system for device indoor localization that uses variations in the strength of the wireless signal. The proposed system addresses logistics use cases in which it is imperative to achieve reliable end-to-end delivery, such as pharmaceutic delivery, delivery of confidential documents and court exhibits, and even food, since the same is introduced into human organism and presents a potential risk of terrorist or other attack. This work proposes a concept based on low-power and low-cost LoRaWAN based system that utilizes a Machine Learning technique based on Neural Networks to achieve high accuracy in device indoor localization by measuring the signal strength of a beacon device. Furthermore, using signal strength measurements, that is, RSSI and SNR captured by LoRaWAN gateways, it is possible to estimate the location of the device point with an accuracy of up to 98.8\%.},

The experiment efficiency of sensor node system by focuses on two parts. The first part, considered the node's communication. We connected sensor node 3 nodes with LoRa base station and operating communication test for 7 days using the sensor node, which purpose to measurement and monitor of soil moisture, temperature, and humidity. Then setting and varying 3 communication parameters namely such as SF (spreading factor), CR (coding rate), d (distance). When any variable is adjusted, other variable is remaining constant. Finally, energy consumption was analyzed with each of variable to determine the suitability for different environments. When SF is high the power consumption is high, which is the highest SF value is 11. When the CR is low the power consumption is high, the lowest CR is 4/8. The second part, we measuring factor of packet's communication, which is following to the LoRa protocol standard. Which the power consumption 73.29 mW/H. From experiment test, the soil moisture sensor nodes have a battery node's lifetime is 6 days and 3 hours. in addition, maximum distance to communication of the soil moisture sensor node is 226 m, with RSSI -116 dBm.},

The new algorithm exploits the properties of Cayley–Menger bideterminants to obtain accurate position location without requiring synchronization among emitters and receivers. Three different resolution approaches for this algorithm are presented here, one of them considering some geometrical constraints. In comparison with traditional methods, such as minimization of non-linear equations by the Gauss–Newton algorithm, this proposal achieves a similar performance with a lower computational load, i.e. is more efficient in this sense. The performance of the algorithm has been validated both by simulation (taking into account the order of complexity for a generic number of beacons) and by real tests in an ultrasonic LPS.},

The weighting algorithms: the weight range localizer (WRL) and relative span exponential weight range localizer (RS-WRL) are using based on received signal strength indicator (RSSI) to estimate the position of target node. As the results, the cumulative distribution function (CDF) probability indicates the error of distance as properly, and this method can help to increase the precision of range based localization method in an application of indoor environment.},

  abstract = {The number of IoT devices has been rising steadily for several years. While a few years ago IoT was still considered a buzzword, today almost every electrical device, from refrigerators to traffic lights, can be connected to the Internet via a corresponding IoT network. However, due to the steadily increasing number of network participants, their demands on the reliability and scalability of the underlying network infrastructure are also rising. In order to cope with the associated challenges, a wide variety of standards have emerged over the years. From special Bluetooth extensions to so-called Low Power Wide Area Technologies (LPWAN). Representatives of the latter approach are the LoRa and LoRaWAN standards. In order to give a first look at these technologies, this thesis deals with the characteristics of the standards and points out possible challenges of the technologies. This work therefore aims to address the question of the extent to which reliable and scalable network infrastructures can be created with the help of LoRa and LoRaWAN. The basis for this is formed by various test series and research work in the context of the technologies. To better differentiate between LoRa and LoRaWAN, the physical layer and the protocol layers above it are considered separately.},

  abstract = {Recently, several indoor localization solutions based on WiFi, Bluetooth, and UWB have been proposed. Due to the limitation and complexity of the indoor environment, the solution to achieve a low-cost and accurate positioning system remains open. This article presents a WiFibased positioning technique that can improve the localization performance from the bottleneck in ToA/AoA. Unlike the traditional approaches, our proposed mechanism relaxes the need for wide signal bandwidth and large numbers of antennas by utilizing the transmission of multiple predefined messages while maintaining high-accuracy performance. The overall system structure is demonstrated by showing localization performance with respect to different numbers of messages used in 20/40 MHz bandwidth WiFi APs. Simulation results show that our WiFi-based positioning approach can achieve 1 m accuracy without any hardware change in commercial WiFi products, which is much better than the conventional solutions from both academia and industry concerning the trade-off of cost and system complexity.},
