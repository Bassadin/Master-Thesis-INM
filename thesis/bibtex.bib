  abstract = {LoRa/LoRaWAN enables long-range links, which result in anisotropic propagation around the gateway as the links are likely to experience different environments. This property is not captured by popular distance based channel models, which makes them inaccurate to estimate LoRaWAN coverage. An alternative is conducting a site survey to build a path loss model, however, despite the many published LoRaWAN site surveys there is no accepted survey methodology. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a well-defined methodology that specifies how to plan and execute a site-survey for LoRa/LoRaWAN. Several disjoint survey paths are explored simultaneously to capture the high spatial variations of LoRaWAN coverage. The proposed methodology was examined in a small, hilly, town in rural Ireland and the measurements were fitted in both a single and dual component (near and far) log-distance path loss model, the latter being more accurate. We also investigated the impact of terrain elevation on the path loss and packet delivery rate, the impact of multipath reflection, and the variation in link quality from indoor and outdoor transmissions. Finally, using the collected measurements, we evaluated how increasing the number of survey paths affects the accuracy of the resulting channel model.},

  abstract = {With the growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), it is critical to understand the packet transmission performance in Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN), especially LoRaWAN. Previous works on LoRaWAN network performance analysis, either simulation-based or field measurement, are considering the Packet Delivery Rate (PDR) as a major measure of the network performance and its dependency on the signal impairments. However, the Effective Signal Power (ESP) and its huge variability along with the different frequency bands, for each location, are not generally considered. In this paper, an in-depth investigation of the frequency dependency of the PDR is done by performing an outdoor measurement campaign in the area of the Campus Beaulieu in Rennes. From each different location, the ESP and SINR (Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio) values are obtained as well as the influence of these parameters on the PDR is evaluated at each frequency band independently. In the given results, the feasibility of using the ESP is proven by its enlarged range when the SINR is very low, unlike the RSSI which has a limitation. This investigation manifests and gives important guidelines for using ESP in the future IoT applications.},

In order to evaluate fingerprinting in large outdoor environments, extensive, time-consuming measurement campaigns need to be conducted to create useful datasets. This paper presents three LPWAN datasets which are collected in large-scale urban and rural areas. The goal is to provide the research community with a tool to evaluate fingerprinting algorithms in large outdoor environments. During a period of three months, numerous mobile devices periodically obtained location data via a GPS receiver which was transmitted via a Sigfox or LoRaWAN message. Together with network information, this location data is stored in the appropriate LPWAN dataset. The first results of our basic fingerprinting implementation, which is also clarified in this paper, indicate a mean location estimation error of 214.58 m for the rural Sigfox dataset, 688.97 m for the urban Sigfox dataset and 398.40 m for the urban LoRaWAN dataset. In the future, we will enlarge our current datasets and use them to evaluate and optimize our fingerprinting methods. Also, we intend to collect additional datasets for Sigfox, LoRaWAN and NB-IoT.},

The main challenge in the LBS domain is the localization of the mobile terminals within a certain accuracy. To this end, several radio positioning techniques have been introduced, one of which is the Location Fingerprinting. Although location fingerprinting has been investigated in some previous works, however there are only few studies that analyze its performance according to physical parameters of the underlying environment. In this paper, we present a performance analysis of the outdoor location fingerprinting systems. We propose a radio propagation model which allows us to introduce some spatial correlations for the shadowing effect and to include the temporal fluctuations of the radio signal. Based on our model, we examine the impact of different physical parameters on the system performance, and thereby we provide a framework which may be useful in the design and implementation of fingerprinting positioning systems.},

  abstract = {LoRa is a popular Low-Power Wide-Area Networking (LP-WAN) technology that allows devices powered by a ten year AA battery to connect to radio infrastructure miles away. One of the most promising features of LoRa is the ability to track the location of radios from a distance, enabling applications ranging from inventory tracking, smart infrastructure monitoring and structural health sensing. Yet, state-of-the-art LoRa localization systems experience errors of several tens or even hundreds of meters in location tracking, owing to the narrow bandwidth and limited battery life of LoRa devices. This paper presents OwLL, a LoRa localization system that limits location error to few meters with commodity LoRa clients in a wide-area network. Our key innovation is the development of a distributed base station network made of individually low-cost components that together span a wide bandwidth that encompasses the TV whitespaces and offers high aperture, crucial to localization accuracy. We demonstrate how this network can aggregate signal measurements made across multiple different narrowband channels of a LoRa client to triangulate it at fine accuracy. We implement and evaluate OwLL on a testbed spanning a large university campus centered in a major U.S. city and demonstrate a 9 m (across line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight) median error in localization.},

  abstract = {The IoT contains billions of interconnected devices and is only growing larger by the day. These devices often need to operate for years while keeping mobile objects, such as animals or vehicles, connected to a larger system. Therefore they will be battery-powered, energy efficient and, their position will be tracked. Therefore, connecting these devices requires low-power, long-range communication that can also be used for localisation. Because of the scale of the IoT industry, manufacturing and infrastructure costs need to be considered. The low cost, long range and energy efficiency that is required exempts many wireless communication and localisation solutions such as WiFi, GPS and Bluetooth because they are not as suitable as LowPower Wide-Area Networks (LPWAN’s). LoRa is a LPWAN technology that is both Long-Range and cost effective. Therefore, the objective of this thesis is to use a LoRa network for our localisation algorithms. In this work we show that signal strength data becomes turbulent when communicating over a large, urban area. Therefore we evaluate Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA)-based localisation algorithms, including a novel area-based algorithm that we developed. We evaluate the localisation algorithms on a proprietary LoRa network which also provides a localisation service that we use as a benchmark. We evaluate the performance of the algorithms over a large, mostly urban, region of The Netherlands. Using mobile LoRa devices, we show that for 80\% of cases, our proposed algorithm has a position error less than 925m. We also show that the other localisation methods, including the proprietary localisation service, have a larger maximum position error for the same portion of cases. This work contributes a localisation algorithm that can compete against proprietary geolocation services, such as Sigfox and KPN’s services, in many applications.},

This paper mainly studies the radio frequency fingerprint technology based on LoRa frequency offset characteristics. First, analyze the LoRa modulation technology, and study the main characteristics of the LoRa modulation technology based on the chirp spread spectrum technology and the physical meaning of several key parameters in the LoRa modulation scheme. Then based on the radio frequency fingerprint technology, the inherent differences between the hardware of different LoRa transmitter modules are studied, the LoRa signal is collected by the USRP device, and the original sampled signal is preprocessed, and the frequency offset is extracted as the radio frequency fingerprint feature of the LoRa terminal device. Features identify different devices. This article uses the radio frequency fingerprint extraction based on the frequency offset LoRa signal. According to the extracted radio frequency fingerprint, the difference between different devices can be well represented. Simulation tests were carried out in different SNR environments, and it was confirmed that the radio frequency fingerprint feature can distinguish different LoRa terminal devices under a lower SNR, and has certain anti-noise performance. This paper also studies the access security mechanism of LoRaWAN, combined with LoRa radio frequency fingerprint identification technology, and proposes an optimized LoRaWAN access security mechanism, which improves the access security performance of LoRaWAN.},

WideSee utilizes the LoRa signal to achieve a larger range of sensing and further incorporates drone's mobility to broaden the sensing area. WideSee presents solutions across software and hardware to overcome two aspects of challenges for wide-range contactless sensing: (i) the interference brought by the device mobility and LoRa's high sensitivity; and (ii) the ambiguous target information such as location when employing just a single pair of transceivers. We have developed a working prototype of WideSee for human target detection and localization that are especially useful in emergency scenarios such as rescue search, and evaluated WideSee with both controlled experiments and the field study in a high-rise building. Extensive experiments demonstrate the great potential of WideSee for wide-area contactless sensing with a single LoRa transceiver pair hosted on a drone.},

A promising technology to achieve the low-power and long-range requirements is seen in LoRaWAN, a media access control (MAC) protocol maintained by the LoRa Alliance and leveraging Semtech's patented LoRa radio modulation technology. LoRaWAN provides three different device classes (A, B and C), which provide a tradeoff between performance (i.e., throughput and latency) and energy consumption. This paper offers a theoretical and experimental comparison of these classes. The objective of the quantitative experiment was twofold: to verify the published current levels of different operating modes in a LoRa chip's datasheet and to compare the battery lifetime for the LoRa class A and C modes of operation. We used a high-end current sensing circuit to gather the voltage levels and temporal variation with increasing payload sizes and spreading factors. Using the Ohmic Law, the energy drain can be calculated and compared across the different spreading factors (SF) and classes.},

  abstract = {Positioning is an essential element in most Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Global Positioning System (GPS) chips have high cost and power consumption, making it unsuitable for long-range (LoRa) and low-power IoT devices. Alternatively, low-power wide-area (LPWA) signals can be used for simultaneous positioning and communication. We summarize previous studies related to LoRa signal-based positioning systems, including those addressing proximity, a path loss model, time difference of arrival (TDoA), and fingerprint positioning methods. We propose a LoRa signal-based positioning method that uses a fingerprint algorithm instead of a received signal strength indicator (RSSI) proximity or TDoA method. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the accuracy and usability of the fingerprint algorithm for large areas in the real world. We estimated the locations using probabilistic means based on three different algorithms that use interpolated fingerprint RSSI maps. The average accuracy of the three proposed algorithms in our experiments was 28.8 m. Our method also reduced the battery consumption significantly compared with that of existing GPS-based positioning methods.},

  abstract = {LoRaWAN is a fast developing Low Power Wide Area Network technology that is predicted to support a large segment of the billions of estimated Internet of Things devices. It promises ubiquitous connectivity keeping network structures and management simple. One open key challenge is how to effectively assign a spreading factor so as to support a large number of end devices by a single gateway within a LoRaWAN cell. This paper confirms that if more clever spreading factor allocation than the conventionally deployed Adaptive Data Rate is considered, network performance will improve significantly. The proposed heuristics are based on two key features; first the fact that each subset of end devices allocated a certain spreading factor represents a spreading factor tier, each signify a logical pure Aloha network with a different packet length. Second, the datum to control coding rate transmission parameter which in turns control coverage sensitivities and thus system load in each spreading factor tier. Two proposed algorithms, namely sensitivitySF and assignmentSF, attempt to maximize the throughput of each spreading factor tier and thus enhance overall network performance. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms can considerably improve network performance when compared to the basic adaptive data rate strategy, and particularly the assignmentSF algorithm consistently guarantees a high success rate for any generated traffic load.},

Very often, hospitalization is not required and at home assistance is a more effective solution. Ambient assisted living technologies can help in mitigating the need for continuous supervision, enabling the elderly to easily look for help in case of emergency. In this work, the well-known and widespread LoRaWAN communication infrastructure is evaluated for possible complementing indoor and outdoor positioning solutions, in order to alert a remotely-connected caregiver about accidents (e.g., falls). The choice of LoRaWAN is dictated by the capability to implement both private and public infrastructures. Satellite-based systems are addressed for outdoor localization, whereas the demanding task of indoor localization is solved by means of Ultra Wide Band technology. Results demonstrated sub-meter error in a typical indoor scenario, with average communication latency on the order of 700 ms.},

  abstract = {Since the appearance of 5G, Internet of Things (IoT) has gained an increased interest, with multiple technologies emerging and converging to cover different user needs. One of the biggest challenges today is to have global IoT coverage, ensuring seamless communication with IoT devices placed in rural and even remote areas. Satellite constellations, and in particular CubeSats orbiting in Low Earth Orbit, can provide a solution to these challenges. Out of the technologies available, LoRa (Long Range) has a great potential for implementation in space-to-Earth satellite communications. As the space-to-Earth channel is different with respect to the conventional Earth-to-Earth one, it is important to asses the capabilities of LoRa in this new environment. This paper presents a study of different LoRa device configurations to identify the constrains for each one and determine which one is better for particular mission requirements. Also, the effect of ionospheric scintillation is assessed with a SDR-based (Software-Defined Radio) test set-up that evaluates the performance of this technology against with Humprey's ionospheric scintillation model. This phenomena produces deep signal intensity fadings and phase fluctuations in equatorial regions, and mainly phase fluctuations in high latitudes. The obtained metrics are the received power and the packet delivery ratio as a function of the intensity scintillation index, and show the robustness of the LoRa modulation in these new environments.},

  abstract = {LoRaWAN is a widespread protocol by which Internet of things end nodes (ENs) can exchange information over long distances via their gateways. To deploy the ENs, it is mandatory to perform a link budget analysis, which allows for determining adequate radio parameters like path loss (PL). Thus, designers use PL models developed based on theoretical approaches or empirical data. Some previous measurement campaigns have been performed to characterize this phenomenon, primarily based on distance and frequency. However, previous works have shown that weather variations also impact PL, so using the conventional approaches and available datasets without capturing important environmental effects can lead to inaccurate predictions. Therefore, this paper delivers a data descriptor that includes a set of LoRaWAN measurements performed in Medellín, Colombia, including PL, distance, frequency, temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure, particulate matter, and energy, among other things. This dataset can be used by designers who need to fit highly accurate PL models. As an example of the dataset usage, we provide some model fittings including log-distance, and multiple linear regression models with environmental effects. This analysis shows that including such variables improves path loss predictions with an RMSE of 1.84 dB and an R2 of 0.917.},

While extending the range of communication links, the ability to provide large scale location-based services (LBS) solutions using native physical layer parameters from IoT networks will dramatically widen the availability of IoT applications. This letter proposes an enhanced Gaussian process-based localization solution for such a low power wide area network (LPWAN). It effectively deals with intermittent signals over a large area caused by low communication throughput, interference or packet collisions in LPWAN. Furthermore, a parametric model enhancement combining indoor and outdoor hypotheses and signal propagation statistics is proposed and evaluated. Field tests over a 37,500 square meter area have been conducted. Results show that the proposed method can provide LBS-quality positioning with a 2-D root mean square error of 20 to 30 meters, with an accuracy improvement of 29.8\% outdoors and 40.6\% indoors, respectively, compared to the traditional fingerprinting method.},

LoRaWAN uses Long Range (LoRa) physical layer and defines Media Access Control layer and general system architecture. One of the main advantage of the LoRa is flexible configuration, which means that it is possible to increase/decrease the bit rate while decreasing/increasing the range. This feature can be very useful in case when propagation conditions change rapidly and frequently, because it allows to configure spreading factor according to the channel conditions. In this paper, we conducted a study of environmental parameters impact in LoRaWAN. We presented design and realization of the testbed for analysis of the impact of temperature and relative humidity changes on Received Signal Strength (RSS) and Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) with manual change of data rate/spreading factor. Our results showed that increase of temperature and relative humidity lead to noticeable degradation of network performances in terms of RSS and SNR. Moreover, we observed that snowing lead to high fluctuations in SNR and RSS when Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) is disabled.},

  abstract = {Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) has drawn the attention of scientists and users all over the world for its wide-ranging Earth observations and applications. Since the end of May 2022, more than 130 satellites are available for fully global operational satellite navigation systems, such as BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS), Galileo, GLONASS and GPS, which have been widely used in positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT), e.g., precise orbit determination and location-based services. Recently, the refracted, reflected, and scattered signals from GNSS can remotely sense the Earth’s surface and atmosphere with potential applications in environmental remote sensing. In this paper, a review of multi-GNSS for Earth Observation and emerging application progress is presented, including GNSS positioning and orbiting, GNSS meteorology, GNSS ionosphere and space weather, GNSS-Reflectometry and GNSS earthquake monitoring, as well as GNSS integrated techniques for land and structural health monitoring. One of the most significant findings from this review is that, nowadays, GNSS is one of the best techniques in the field of Earth observation, not only for traditional positioning applications, but also for integrated remote sensing applications. With continuous improvements and developments in terms of performance, availability, modernization, and hybridizing, multi-GNSS will become a milestone for Earth observations and future applications.},

Modern GNSS now consist of four independent global satellite constellations delivering modernized signals at multiple civil frequencies. New ground monitoring infrastructure, mathematical models, and internet services correct for errors in the GNSS signals at continent scale. Mass-market automotive-grade receiver chipsets are available at low Cost, Size, Weight, and Power (CSWaP). The result is that GNSS in 2020 delivers better than lane-level accurate localization with 99.99999\% integrity guarantees at over 95\% availability. In autonomous driving, SAE Level 2 partially autonomous vehicles are now available to consumers, capable of autonomously following lanes and performing basic maneuvers under human supervision. Furthermore, the first pilot programs of SAE Level 4 driverless vehicles are being demonstrated on public roads. However, autonomous driving is not a solved problem. GNSS can help. Specifically, incorporating high-integrity GNSS lane determination into vision-based architectures can unlock lane-level maneuvers and provide oversight to guarantee safety. Incorporating precision GNSS into LiDAR-based systems can unlock robustness and additional fallbacks for safety and utility. Lastly, GNSS provides interoperability through consistent timing and reference frames for future V2X scenarios.},

In this paper, a novel sensor grid using 40 KHz ultrasonic transmitters is presented for adoption in indoor 3D positioning applications. In the proposed technique, a vehicle measures the arrival time of incoming ultrasonic signals and calculates the position without broadcasting to the grid. This system allows for conducting silent or covert operations and can also be used for the simultaneous navigation of a large number of vehicles. The transmitters and receivers employed are first described. Transmission lobe patterns and receiver directionality determine the geometry of transmitter clusters. Range and accuracy of measurements dictate the number of sensors required to navigate in a given volume. Laboratory experiments were performed in which a small array of transmitters was set up and the sensor system was tested for position accuracy. The prototype system is shown to have a 1-sigma position error of about 16 cm, with errors between 7 and 11 cm in the local horizontal coordinates. This research work provides foundations for the future development of ultrasonic navigation sensors for a variety of autonomous vehicle applications.},

  abstract = {The presented direct location method computes the 3D position of an object using exactly four time-of-arrival (TOA) measurements, i.e. range measurements, to four reference points or stations. This operation is also commonly known as multilateration. Traditionally, this problem can also be solved using three TOA measurements to three reference stations, i.e. trilateration. However, a twofold ambiguity, usually of the vertical component, arises, which cannot be resolved without some prior knowledge about the general location of the object or an extra TOA measurement. The developed algorithm is simpler and faster than conventional ones, thus, complexity in terms of time, power consumption, and chip area is reduced. Therefore, the algorithm is suitable for applications with limited computational and power resources.},

  abstract = {With the advancement of low-power and low-cost wireless technologies in the past few years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has been growing rapidly in numerous areas of Industry 4.0 and smart homes. With the development of many applications for the IoT, indoor localization, i.e., the capability to determine the physical location of people or devices, has become an important component of smart homes. Various wireless technologies have been used for indoor localization including WiFi, ultra-wideband (UWB), Bluetooth low energy (BLE), radio-frequency identification (RFID), and LoRa. The ability of low-cost long range (LoRa) radios for low-power and long-range communication has made this radio technology a suitable candidate for many indoor and outdoor IoT applications. Additionally, research studies have shown the feasibility of localization with LoRa radios. However, indoor localization with LoRa is not adequately explored at the home level, where the localization area is relatively smaller than offices and corporate buildings. In this study, we first explore the feasibility of ranging with LoRa. Then, we conduct experiments to demonstrate the capability of LoRa for accurate and precise indoor localization in a typical apartment setting. Our experimental results show that LoRa-based indoor localization has an accuracy better than 1.6 m in line-of-sight scenario and 3.2 m in extreme non-line-of-sight scenario with a precision better than 25 cm in all cases, without using any data filtering on the location estimates.},

  abstract = {Smart farms and IoT (Internet of Things) have an inseparable relationship. Sensors, gateways, servers, databases, web-based applications, are all widely used by connected smart farms. Also, the range of communication availability, the amount of power required for communication, and required equipment are differs depending on the networking technology. Hence, the decision of networking technology is very important when implementing a smart farm. While there are many networking technologies, LoRa (Long Range) is one of the most common Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) in use by smart farms in the United States. Theoretically, APRS (Automatic Packet Reporting System) can communicate at greater distances than LoRa. Therefore, the study compares the feasibility of LoRa and APRS in smart farms by measuring the distance coverage of the two networking technologies. All three tests were conducted at the Purdue Agronomy Center for Research and Education where the transmitting antennas were mobile that moved via cars, and the receiving antennas were installed at the same tower. The distances were calculated by using Google Maps, where all the locations for the transmitting points were saved. From evaluating the test results, this paper concludes that LoRa is a more feasible wireless connection than APRS in the smart farm IoT system.},

  abstract = {The vision of tracking small IoT devices runs into the reality of localization technologies --- today it is difficult to continuously track objects through walls in homes and warehouses on a coin cell battery. While Wi-Fi and ultra-wideband radios can provide tracking through walls, they do not last more than a month on small coin and button cell batteries since they consume tens of milliwatts of power. We present the first localization system that consumes microwatts of power at a mobile device and can be localized across multiple rooms in settings like homes and hospitals. To this end, we introduce a multi-band backscatter prototype that operates across 900 MHz, 2.4 and 5 GHz and can extract the backscatter phase information from signals that are below the noise floor. We build sub-centimeter sized prototypes which consume 93 μW and could last five to ten years on button cell batteries. We achieved ranges of up to 60 m away from the AP and accuracies of 2, 12, 50 and 145 cm at 1, 5, 30 and 60 m respectively. To demonstrate the potential of our design, we deploy it in two real-world scenarios: five homes in a metropolitan area and the surgery wing of a hospital in patient pre-op and post-op rooms as well as storage facilities.},

However, for environment with many obstacles and blind spots, the classical star network has limitation in area coverage. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the LoRaWAN extender using multiple relays in terms of coverage ability, performance, and power consumption. In this research, the design and implementation of a multiple relay system compatible with the LoRaWAN protocol is studied to extend the coverage of a classical LoRaWAN gateway. The relay can have multiple years of operation with a compact battery. These relays were deployed along a deep river will complex terrain that the gateway can not fully cover. The longest distance of each relay was recorded so that the packets sent by the previous relay were still received by the next relay, the packet loss ratio and latency were calculated to evaluate the performance, and power consumption was measured by using a power analyzer. The results show the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed design for multiple relays to extend the LoRaWAN network.},

  abstract = {LoRa is a Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) technology for Internet of Things (IoTs) application. Its advantages are low power consumption, inexpensive equipment cost, highly- secure access, and most importantly, good for long-range communication. Currently, LoRa network are extensively deployed worldwide. In the near future, that LoRa gateway may not be able to provide sufficient coverage for the ever-increasing deployment. A solution is to move the LoRa gateway up high to the satellite. The objective of this study was to theoretically investigate the feasibility of successful communication between ground sensor and LoRa gateway mounted in a satellite. In this study, sets of transmission parameters were analyzed whether, in principles, they would be able to support such kind of communication setup. For example, LoRa communicated in the frequency band 923 \&ndash; 925 MHz in Thailand. Modified mathematical expressions were derived for link budget calculation. Using certain assumptions and this mathematical model, we discovered that, in principles, a suitable set of transmission parameters would be able to make the link budget sufficiently high so that this communication scheme would be feasible. The findings from this study may directly benefit developers of new applications of LoRa and IoTs satellite in their effort to design a communication scheme for their system. Nevertheless, the discovered feasibility was from the standpoints of theoretical matters. A valid experiment is needed in a future research to actually confirm this feasibility.},

Secondly, we analytically investigate the signal demodulation technique. Quite surprisingly, we found that its effectiveness depends on the particular choice of the sampling frequency at the receiver side, which purposely does not meet the sampling theorem requirement. Finally, we consider the actual architecture of digital receivers investigating the trade-off between the selectivity of receive digital filters, which impacts on the required computational effort and power consumption, and the receiver performance.},

As a result, IoT devices must be able to handle data collection, machine-to-machine (M2M) communication, and preprocessing of data, while also considering cost, processing power, and energy consumption. This paper introduces a system for device indoor localization that uses variations in the strength of the wireless signal. The proposed system addresses logistics use cases in which it is imperative to achieve reliable end-to-end delivery, such as pharmaceutic delivery, delivery of confidential documents and court exhibits, and even food, since the same is introduced into human organism and presents a potential risk of terrorist or other attack. This work proposes a concept based on low-power and low-cost LoRaWAN based system that utilizes a Machine Learning technique based on Neural Networks to achieve high accuracy in device indoor localization by measuring the signal strength of a beacon device. Furthermore, using signal strength measurements, that is, RSSI and SNR captured by LoRaWAN gateways, it is possible to estimate the location of the device point with an accuracy of up to 98.8\%.},

We connected sensor node 3 nodes with LoRa base station and operating communication test for 7 days using the sensor node, which purpose to measurement and monitor of soil moisture, temperature, and humidity. Then setting and varying 3 communication parameters namely such as SF (spreading factor), CR (coding rate), d (distance). When any variable is adjusted, other variable is remaining constant. Finally, energy consumption was analyzed with each of variable to determine the suitability for different environments. When SF is high the power consumption is high, which is the highest SF value is 11. When the CR is low the power consumption is high, the lowest CR is 4/8. The second part, we measuring factor of packet's communication, which is following to the LoRa protocol standard. Which the power consumption 73.29 mW/H.

In realizing the vision of the Internet of Things, LPWA technologies complement and sometimes supersede the conventional cellular and short range wireless technologies in performance for various emerging smart city and machine-to-machine applications. This review paper presents the design goals and the techniques, which different LPWA technologies exploit to offer wide-area coverage to low-power devices at the expense of low data rates. We survey several emerging LPWA technologies and the standardization activities carried out by different standards development organizations (e.g., IEEE, IETF, 3GPP, ETSI) as well as the industrial consortia built around individual LPWA technologies (e.g., LoRa Alliance, Weightless-SIG, and Dash7 alliance). We further note that LPWA technologies adopt similar approaches, thus sharing similar limitations and challenges. This paper expands on these research challenges and identifies potential directions to address them. While the proprietary LPWA technologies are already hitting the market with large nationwide roll-outs, this paper encourages an active engagement of the research community in solving problems that will shape the connectivity of tens of billions of devices in the next decade.},

More specifically, this paper focuses on chirp spread spectrum (CSS). This paper presents a detailed model of CSS, showing that the symbols are not perfectly orthogonal. The results show the potential communication ranges are close to narrowband networks and the robustness against interfering signals is 22 dB better for spreading factor 10 than BPSK. Although wideband communication is robust to interference, in long range communication, this robustness is insufficient due to the long range and the larger footprint. The large propagation losses due to the long range and the larger footprint make CSS prone to collisions with other noise sources, possibly larger than the coding gain.},

The new algorithm exploits the properties of Cayley–Menger bideterminants to obtain accurate position location without requiring synchronization among emitters and receivers. Three different resolution approaches for this algorithm are presented here, one of them considering some geometrical constraints. In comparison with traditional methods, such as minimization of non-linear equations by the Gauss–Newton algorithm, this proposal achieves a similar performance with a lower computational load, i.e. is more efficient in this sense. The performance of the algorithm has been validated both by simulation (taking into account the order of complexity for a generic number of beacons) and by real tests in an ultrasonic LPS.},

In this paper we analyse available IoT security in three forms: (i) security in communication, (ii) security at application interface, and (iii) data security. This paper reviews the current IoT technologies, approaches and models and finds the security gap in existing communication technologies, application interfaces, and data security.

The weighting algorithms: the weight range localizer (WRL) and relative span exponential weight range localizer (RS-WRL) are using based on received signal strength indicator (RSSI) to estimate the position of target node. As the results, the cumulative distribution function (CDF) probability indicates the error of distance as properly, and this method can help to increase the precision of range based localization method in an application of indoor environment.},

  abstract = {The number of IoT devices has been rising steadily for several years. While a few years ago IoT was still considered a buzzword, today almost every electrical device, from refrigerators to traffic lights, can be connected to the Internet via a corresponding IoT network. However, due to the steadily increasing number of network participants, their demands on the reliability and scalability of the underlying network infrastructure are also rising. In order to cope with the associated challenges, a wide variety of standards have emerged over the years. From special Bluetooth extensions to so-called Low Power Wide Area Technologies (LPWAN). Representatives of the latter approach are the LoRa and LoRaWAN standards. In order to give a first look at these technologies, this thesis deals with the characteristics of the standards and points out possible challenges of the technologies. This work therefore aims to address the question of the extent to which reliable and scalable network infrastructures can be created with the help of LoRa and LoRaWAN. The basis for this is formed by various test series and research work in the context of the technologies. To better differentiate between LoRa and LoRaWAN, the physical layer and the protocol layers above it are considered separately.},

Currently, outdoor positioning has been a great success; however, indoor positioning technologies are in the early stages of development. Therefore, this paper provides an overview of indoor fingerprint positioning based on Wi-Fi. First, some indoor positioning technologies, especially the Wi-Fi fingerprint indoor positioning technology, are introduced and discussed. Second, some evaluation metrics and influence factors of indoor fingerprint positioning technologies based on Wi-Fi are introduced. Third, methods and algorithms of fingerprint indoor positioning technologies are analyzed, classified, and discussed. Fourth, some widely used assistive positioning technologies are described. Finally, conclusions are drawn and future possible research interests are discussed. It is hoped that this research will serve as a stepping stone for those interested in advancing indoor positioning.},

Due to the limitation and complexity of the indoor environment, the solution to achieve a low-cost and accurate positioning system remains open. This article presents a WiFibased positioning technique that can improve the localization performance from the bottleneck in ToA/AoA. Unlike the traditional approaches, our proposed mechanism relaxes the need for wide signal bandwidth and large numbers of antennas by utilizing the transmission of multiple predefined messages while maintaining high-accuracy performance. The overall system structure is demonstrated by showing localization performance with respect to different numbers of messages used in 20/40 MHz bandwidth WiFi APs. Simulation results show that our WiFi-based positioning approach can achieve 1 m accuracy without any hardware change in commercial WiFi products, which is much better than the conventional solutions from both academia and industry concerning the trade-off of cost and system complexity.},

  abstract = {In this work, a complete multiangulation system was developed and its performance in term of position estimation (PE) was determined. The developed system uses Bartlett’s beam forming method to estimate AOA of the signal impinging on the 16-element sensor array in a uniform linear array (ULA) geometry at each ground receiving station (GRS). The AOA measurements are then used as input to a linear angulation algorithm for PE. The PE accuracy of the developed system was determined using Monte Carlo simulation and compared with the directional rotating antenna multiangulation system using a square GRS configuration. Simulation results shows that the developed multiangulation PE error is 50\% lower than that of the directional rotating antenna system. Furthermore, the PE error of the developed system is higher for emitting sources within the system coverage with position bearings within 610 to 1200 and 2400 to 3000 than other emitting source locations.Keywords: multiangulation system, position estimation, beam forming, Monte Carlo Simulation, position bearing},
