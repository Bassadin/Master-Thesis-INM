\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Motivation}

The global market for IoT devices is expected to grow from 397.62 B USD in 2019 to 1,110 B USD by 2028~\cite{grand_view_research_global_2022}.
Over short ranges, it is relatively easy to connect devices to the internet wirelessly with technologies such as ZigBee.
Bridging long distances, however, can become a challenge if devices are also to consume as little power as possible.

The wireless communication protocol \ac{LoRa} promises to address this challenge by offering a vast range with the drawback of having very little throughput.
The longest transmission range of a \ac{LoRa} device, under ideal conditions, has been measured at 832 km~\cite{the_things_network_global_team_lora_nodate}.
While, realistically, such devices usually reach much shorter distances, they can still be used to connect devices over long distances of multiple kilometers.

While \ac{LoRa} end devices can feature \ac{GPS} receivers to geolocate them when deployed, they use additional space and, more importantly, power.
This is especially problematic for battery-powered devices that are deployed in remote areas.
Contrary to \ac{GPS}, \ac{LoRa} nodes may also be geolocated without a GPS receiver by using the signals they send to the \ac{LoRa} Gateways in the network.

Using available \ac{LoRa} Gateways that are registered in \acf{TTN} as well as placing new ones in the vicinity of the \acf{HFU}, this thesis aims to analyze and compare \ac{GPS}-less methods to geolocate off-the-shelf \ac{LoRaWAN} nodes.

\section{Research Questions}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item In what ways can \ac{LoRa} devices be geolocated without the need for a GPS receiver?
    \item How do these ways compare to each other?
    \item What factors can influence the accuracy of these kinds of geolocation?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Existing Work}

Some papers have already looked into the topic of geolocation of \ac{LoRa} devices.
\cite{mackey_lora-based_2019}~used some \ac{LoRa} gateways over relatively short distances to geolocate \ac{LoRa} devices by using their signal strength RSSI values.
In another example,~\cite{lam_new_2018} proposed a method to geolocate \ac{LoRa} devices using a new kind of algorithm that is also based on RSSI values.

Gu et al. researched \ac{LoRa}-based localization in 2018.
They came concluded that both \ac{ToA} and \ac{RSSI} based methods have their downsides and are not accurate enough for any task that requires precision, such as steering of autonomous vehicles and similar use cases~\cite{gu_lora-based_2018}.
