\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Motivation}

The global market for \ac{IoT} devices is expected to grow from USD 397.42 billion in 2022 to USD 1,110 billion in 2028~\cite{lionel_sujay_vailshery_global_2022}.
Over short distances and with mains-powered devices, it is relatively easy to achieve connections to the internet wirelessly with technologies such as ZigBee, Thread of Wi-Fi.
However, bridging long distances can become a challenge when devices also need to be autonomous which means to consume as little power as possible.

The wireless communication protocol \ac{LoRa} promises to address this challenge by offering a vast range with the drawback of having little throughput.
The longest transmission range of a \ac{LoRa} device, under ideal conditions, has been measured at 832 km~\cite{the_things_network_global_team_lora_nodate}.
While, realistically, such devices usually reach much shorter distances, they can still be used to connect devices over long distances of multiple kilometers.
In the first half of 2020, \ac{LoRa} was the second most used \ac{LPWAN} technology worldwide, scoring 41\% and ranking just behind NB-IoT with 44\%~\cite{iot_analytics_lpwa_2020}.

While \ac{LoRa} end devices can feature \ac{GPS} receivers to geolocate them when deployed, they use additional space and, more importantly, power.
This is especially problematic for battery-powered devices that are deployed in remote areas.
Contrary to \ac{GPS}, \ac{LoRa} nodes may also be geolocated without a \ac{GPS} receiver by using the signals they send to the \ac{LoRa} Gateways in the network.

The aim of this thesis is to analyze and compare \ac{GPS}-less methods for geolocating standard \ac{LoRaWAN} nodes without modifying them or the gateways used.
The aim is not to focus specifically on indoor or outdoor applications specifically but to provide a general overview of the topic.
To achieve this, available \ac{LoRa} Gateways that are registered in \acf{TTN} as well as new ones placed in the vicinity of Furtwangen were used.

\section{Research Questions}

% TODO refine those

\begin{enumerate}
      \item In what ways can \ac{LoRa} devices be geolocated without the need for a \ac{GPS} receiver?
      \item How do these ways compare to each other?
      \item What factors can influence the accuracy of these kinds of geolocation?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Existing / Related Work}

Some papers have already looked into the topic of geolocation of \ac{LoRa} devices.
Mackey et al.~used \ac{LoRa} gateways over relatively short distances to geolocate \ac{LoRa} devices by using their \ac{RSSI} values~\cite{mackey_lora-based_2019}.

In another example, Lam et al.~proposed a method to geolocate \ac{LoRa} devices using a new kind of algorithm that is also based on \ac{RSSI} values~\cite{lam_new_2018}.

Gu et al.\ researched \ac{LoRa}-based localization in 2018.
They concluded that both \ac{ToA} and \ac{RSSI} based methods are flawed and are not accurate enough for any task that requires precision, such as steering of autonomous vehicles and similar use cases~\cite{gu_lora-based_2018}.

This year in January, Perković et al.\ published a paper on the topic of \ac{LoRa}-based indoor localization.
In addition to \ac{RSSI} and \ac{SNR} values, they used machine learning to improve the accuracy of their localization~\cite{perkovic_machine_2023}.

Anagnostopoulos and Kalousis compared some fingerprinting based localization methods for \ac{LoRaWAN} in 2019~\cite{anagnostopoulos_reproducible_2019}.
They used methods like \ac{kNN} as well as a neural network approach.
