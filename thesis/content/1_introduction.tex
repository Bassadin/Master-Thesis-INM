\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Motivation}

The global market for \ac{IoT} devices is expected to grow from 397.62 B USD in 2019 to 1,110 B USD by 2028~\cite{grand_view_research_global_2022}.

Over short ranges, it is relatively easy to connect devices to the internet wirelessly with technologies such as ZigBee.
Bridging long distances, however, can become a challenge if devices are also to consume as little power as possible.

The wireless communication protocol \ac{LoRa} promises to address this challenge by offering a vast range with the drawback of having very little throughput.
The longest transmission range of a \ac{LoRa} device, under ideal conditions, has been measured at 832 km~\cite{the_things_network_global_team_lora_nodate}.
While, realistically, such devices usually reach much shorter distances, they can still be used to connect devices over long distances of multiple kilometers.

While \ac{LoRa} end devices can feature \ac{GPS} receivers to geolocate them when deployed, they use additional space and, more importantly, power.
This is especially problematic for battery-powered devices that are deployed in remote areas.
Contrary to \ac{GPS}, \ac{LoRa} nodes may also be geolocated without a \ac{GPS} receiver by using the signals they send to the \ac{LoRa} Gateways in the network.

Using available \ac{LoRa} Gateways that are registered in \acf{TTN} as well as placing new ones in the vicinity of the \acf{HFU}, this thesis aims to analyze and compare \ac{GPS}-less methods to geolocate off-the-shelf \ac{LoRaWAN} nodes.

\section{Research Questions}

\begin{enumerate}
      \item In what ways can \ac{LoRa} devices be geolocated without the need for a \ac{GPS} receiver?
      \item How do these ways compare to each other?
      \item What factors can influence the accuracy of these kinds of geolocation?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Existing Work}

Some papers have already looked into the topic of geolocation of \ac{LoRa} devices.
Mackey et al. used some \ac{LoRa} gateways over relatively short distances to geolocate \ac{LoRa} devices by using their \ac{RSSI} values~\cite{mackey_lora-based_2019}.

In another example, Lam et al. proposed a method to geolocate \ac{LoRa} devices using a new kind of algorithm that is also based on \ac{RSSI} values~\cite{lam_new_2018}.

Gu et al. researched \ac{LoRa}-based localization in 2018.
They concluded that both \ac{ToA} and \ac{RSSI} based methods are flawed and are not accurate enough for any task that requires precision, such as steering of autonomous vehicles and similar use cases~\cite{gu_lora-based_2018}.

\section{Expression of Thanks}

I would like to express my thanks to several parties for the help they provided me with during the creation of this thesis:

My supervising professor Prof. Dr. Richard Zahoransky, for his support and guidance throughout the thesis.
He helped me channel my motivation for the topic into productiveness and provided me with valuable feedback.

The Netzint GmbH in Gütenbach and Mr. Tom Lehmann in specific, for helping me by explaining the implementation of \ac{LoRaWAN} technology into a company's infrastructure in Furtwangen.

The EGT GmbH from Triberg, for providing some insight into their own endeavors with \ac{LoRaWAN} technology.

The \ac{GHB} netadmins team, who spent several hours helping me to install hardware within the building infrastructure they manage as well as configuring the external access needed to control and configure it.

Mr. Ralf Schellhammer, for providing me with the necessary hardware to conduct the experiments.
His motivation in explaining technical intricacies of radio transmission and his willingness to help me with installing some \ac{LoRaWAN} gateways was invaluable.

Mr. Odin Jäger, owner of the \ac{HFU} O building, for providing me with the opportunity to install a gateway on top of that building.

Mr. Martin Kramer, for configuring the network I used for the gateways as well as connecting them to the \ac{HFU} network infrastructure.
