\section{Outlook}

\subsection{Projects made possible due to new gateways in Furtwangen}

\subsection{Further research}

% TODO: if nanosecond level timestamps are available, the ToA method can be used to determine the position of the gateway. This would allow for a more accurate positioning of the gateway, which would in turn allow for a more accurate positioning of the nodes.
