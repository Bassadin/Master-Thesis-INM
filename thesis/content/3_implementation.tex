\section{Installing gateways in Furtwangen}

\section{A, B and C buildings}

The first antenna and gateway installed to last was the MikroTik antenna on top of the \ac{HFU} C building as seen in \cref{pic:mikrotik-antenna-c-building}.
While not as high in altitude as the GHB building, it is still a good location to receive signals from the surrounding area.
