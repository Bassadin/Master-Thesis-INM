\chapter{Background}

\section{Wireless Communications}

This section aims to provide a general overview of relevant wireless communication terminology and other principles necessary to understand the more hardware-oriented part of this thesis.

\subsection{Problems with established wireless communication techniques}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{pictures/lora/comparison-wireless-protocols.png}
    \caption{
        Comparison of data rate, power consumption and range between different wireless communication protocols.
        While \ac{LoRaWAN} has significantly lower data rates compared to cellular networks, its power consumption and cost is also much lower.~\protect\cite{wang_comparison_2021}
    }\label{pic:wireless-protocols-comparison}
\end{figure}

While there are sensors that can be connected to the internet using Wi-Fi, ZigBee, \ac{LTE} and other, these technologies are not suitable for all use cases.

Deployments in remote or particularly large areas may require long-range transmissions.
As such, sensors that are deployed in such areas may be hard to reach or placed apart by several hundred meters.
This makes low power sensors that can run on batteries for several months to years a necessity, as battery replacement can be expensive or even impossible.

For example, Wi-Fi is not suitable for battery powered devices used in remote areas because it requires relatively high power to operate and does not have a long range.
ZigBee is also not suitable for battery powered devices because it is not designed for long distances and therefore has a short range.
\ac{LTE} is also not suitable for battery powered devices either as it requires a lot of power.
A rough comparison between selected wireless protocols can be seen in \cref{pic:wireless-protocols-comparison}~\cite{wang_comparison_2021}.

\subsection{\acf{RSSI}}\label{sec:rssi}

The \acf{RSSI} is a measure of the strength of a wireless signal received by a device.
As far as this thesis is concerned, \ac{RSS} values are measured in dBm since the \ac{TTN} \ac{LNS}, the basis for all data used, uses this unit as well~\cite{the_things_industries_bv_data_2023}.

Different devices can have different \ac{RSS} values for the same distance because of factors such as antennas with different gains.
Furthermore, \ac{RSS} values can only function reliably when there is nothing blocking the signal between the transmitting and receiving stations, e.g.,\ if there is a \acl{LoS} between the sender and receiver.
The \ac{RF} signal can be blocked and thereby attenuated by walls, trees, or other objects --- a phenomenon known as \acf{MPP}~\cite{kucherov_investigation_2021}.

\subsubsection{Correlation between \acs{RSS} values and distance --- \acf{FSPL}}\label{sec:background-free-space-path-loss}

Usually, the higher the \ac{RSS} value, the closer the sender is to the receiver since the signal is stronger when the radio waves have to travel a shorter distance~\cite{stutzman_antenna_1981}.
When using two non-directional (isotropic) antennas, there is a certain correlation between the distance between the sender and receiver and the \ac{RSSI} value.

The equation to calculate this so-called \acl{FSPL} in decibels can be seen in \cref{eq:fspl}~\cite[p. 1321]{whitaker_electronics_1996}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:fspl}
    FSPL_{dB} = 20 \log_{10}\left(\frac{4 \pi d}{\lambda}\right)
\end{equation}

$d$ is the distance between sender and receiver, while $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the signal.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:wavelength-of-a-signal}
    \lambda = \frac{c}{f}
\end{equation}

To calculate the wavelength of a signal, the formula seen in \cref{eq:wavelength-of-a-signal} is used, where $\lambda$ is the wavelength, $c$ is the speed of light, and $f$ is the frequency.
As the \ac{LoRa} modulation operates at \SI{868}{\mega\hertz} in the \ac{EU}, its wavelength can be calculated as $\lambda = \frac{299792458 \text{ m/s}}{868 \times 10^6 \text{ Hz}} \approx 0.345 \text{ m}$~\cite{lora_alliance_inc_lorawan_regional_2017}.

As an example, the \acl{FSPL} in \si{\decibel} for a distance of \SI{1}{\kilo\metre} (\SI{1000}{\metre}) with the \ac{LoRa} frequency can be calculated as follows: $20 \log_{10}\left(\frac{4 \pi \times 1000}{0.345}\right) \approx 91.23 \text{ dB}$.

\subsubsection{\acf{MPP}}\label{sec:multipath-propagation}

In addition to a signal reaching its destination directly, a \ac{RF} transmission phenomenon called \acf{MPP} can occur.
\acl{MPP} causes the \ac{RSS} values to fluctuate even when neither the distance between the transmitter and receiver nor their antennas change~\cite[p. 136]{abdelfadeel_how_2019}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{pictures/diagrams_figures/multipath_propagation.jpg}
    \caption{
        Examples for different types of \acf{MPP} effects of \ac{RF} waves.
        Notably, all of them make the signal's travel time longer than a direct \ac{LoS} path would take.
        This longer travel time in turn also decreases the \ac{RSS} value measured by the receiver.~\protect\cite{milosevic_key_2017}
    }\label{pic:figure_multipath_propagation}
\end{figure}

This is because the signal can be reflected, diffracted, refracted and scattered, taking multiple paths (hence the term \acl{MPP}) as shown in \cref{pic:figure_multipath_propagation}.

\subsection{\acf{SNR}}\label{sec:background-snr}

Since the \SI{868}{\mega\hertz} frequency band used for \ac{LoRa} in the \ac{EU} is unlicensed, it is possible that other devices use the same frequency band~\cite{etsi_etsi_2012}.
This can result in a relatively high level of so-called radio noise~\cite[p. 6]{fujdiak_insights_2022}.

The \acf{SNR} is a measure of the strength of the signal compared to the noise in the signal~\cite{johnson_signal--noise_2006}.
Its formula is as follows:

\begin{equation}
    \text{SNR} = \frac{P_{Signal}}{P_{Noise}}
\end{equation}

A \ac{SNR} of 1 means that the signal and the noise are equally strong.
While a \ac{SNR} above 1 indicates a signal that is stronger than the noise, a \ac{SNR} below 1 indicates a signal that is weaker than the noise.
The \ac{SNR} can be impacted by several environmental factors, such as the temperature and humidity of the air~\cite{jeftenic_impact_2020}.
While the \ac{SNR} can also be expressed in \si{\decibel}, in this thesis it is expressed as a ratio because \ac{TTN} uses that format.

\section{Terminology: \acs{LoRa} vs. \acs{LoRaWAN}}

\acf{LoRa} is a \ac{RF} communication modulation that offers a standard to send data packets over the air in a specific way~\cite{semtech_corporation_lora_2023}.
A rough explanation of its technical details will be given in \cref{sec:lora-modulation}.

\ac{LoRaWAN} is a network protocol that uses \ac{LoRa} as its physical layer to transmit data packets.
It will be explained in more detail in \cref{sec:lorawan}.

\section{\acf{LoRa} modulation}\label{sec:lora-modulation}

The \ac{LoRa} modulation is also sometimes referred to as \ac{LoRa}\ PHY~\cite{chaudhari_understanding_2022}.
It uses several techniques to achieve long-range communication with low power consumption.
In the \ac{EU}, it uses the \SI{868}{\mega\hertz} frequency band to transmit data~\cite{lora_alliance_inc_lorawan_regional_2017}.
This frequency band was also used exclusively in the experiments conducted for this thesis.

This section will explain some of its concepts that are relevant to this thesis.
However, it will not go into detail about all the technical details of the modulation.

\subsection{\acf{CSS}}\label{sec:chirp-spread-spectrum}

\ac{LoRa} uses a technique called \acl{CSS} to transmit data with the possibility for error detection and correction~\cite{reynders_chirp_2016}.
\acs{CHIRP} stands for \acl{CHIRP}.
It uses frequency hopping and different \aclp{SF} to encode signals in order to make them robust against interference, as will be explained in \cref{sec:spreading-factors}.

\subsection{Duty Cycle (in the \acs{EU} region)}\label{sec:duty-cycle}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{pictures/lora/duty-cycle-single-channel-off-air.png}
    \caption{
        Schematic example of duty cycle in \ac{LoRa}.
        For this example, the duty cycle is \SI{20}{\percent}.~\protect\cite{the_things_industries_bv_duty_nodate}
    }\label{pic:lora-duty-cycle}
\end{figure}

In the \ac{EU} region, the duty cycle for transmissions in the \SI{868}{\mega\hertz} band is limited to \SI{1}{\percent}~\cite[p. 29]{etsi_etsi_2012}.
This means that a \ac{LoRa} device using this frequency band may only transmit for \SI{1}{\percent} of a given time slot.
For example, if a device transmits data for 36 seconds, it must stay silent for the following 3,564 seconds, which is almost an hour.
It needs to stay silent for the rest of the time slot.

An example for duty cycle time frames can be seen in \cref{pic:lora-duty-cycle}.
In this example, the duty cycle is \SI{20}{\percent}.
The device that transmits for one block of time needs to stay silent for the next four time blocks before it can transmit again.
To stay compliant with the \SI{20}{\percent} duty cycle, it may start a new transmission starting with the sixth time block.

Luckily, LoRa packets are usually only a few bytes small and can thus be transmitted in a short amount of time, usually in a few milliseconds.
Even when using \acs{SF}12, which is the slowest \acs{SF} available, the maximum packet size of \SI{51}{\byte} can be transmitted in  \SI{1232.9}{\milli\second}~\cite[p. 6]{the_things_network_lorawan_nodate}\cite[p. 10f]{lora_alliance_inc_lorawan_regional_2017}.
This makes it possible to transmit data up to every few minutes even with the largest possible packet size and still stay compliant with the duty cycle of \SI{1}{\percent}.

The \emph{ETSI} standard also defines the \acf{ERP} that can be emitted from a device's antenna in this frequency band as \SI{25}{\milli\watt}~\cite[p. 29]{etsi_etsi_2012}.
``\ac{ERP} is the power radiated from the tip of the antenna'' after taking into account the antenna's gain and the cable loss~\cite[p. 23]{faruque_radio_2015}.

\subsection{\acfp{SF}}\label{sec:spreading-factors}

The \ac{LoRa} modulation uses different \aclp{SF} to transmit data~\cite{the_things_network_spreading_2023}.
The \acl{SF} determines the \ac{CHIRP} rate and thereby the data rate and range of the transmission.

There are six different \aclp{SF} available in the \ac{EU} region, ranging from \ac{SF}7 to \ac{SF}12.
\ac{SF}7 offers the highest data rate and the lowest range, while \ac{SF}12 offers the lowest data rate and the highest range.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{pictures/lora/SF_Comparison_7_12.png}
    \caption{
        Comparison of \aclp{SF} \ac{SF}7 to \ac{SF} 12 in the time and frequency dimensions.
        The doubling of the transmission time between increasing \aclp{SF} can be seen.\protect\cite{sakshama_ghoslya_lora_2017}
    }\label{pic:lora-sf-comparison}
\end{figure}

\Cref{pic:lora-sf-comparison} shows the difference between different \aclp{SF} in the time and frequency dimensions.
It shows that the higher the \ac{SF}, the longer the transmission takes.
In fact, the transmission time is proportional to $2^{\text{SF}}$~\cite{sakshama_ghoslya_lora_2017}.
This means that, for example, a transmission using \ac{SF}10 takes twice as long as a transmission using \ac{SF}9.

While a higher \acl{SF} means that data can be transmitted over a longer range, the transmission also takes longer.
Given the 1\% duty cycle in the \ac{EU} region mentioned in \cref{sec:duty-cycle}, this also means that using a higher \acl{SF} reduces the maximum amount of data that can be transmitted in any given timeframe.

Different \aclp{SF} are orthogonal to each other, so they can be used at the same time without interfering with each other~\cite{the_things_network_spreading_2023}.

The \ac{SF} also determines the maximum size of the payload that can be transmitted.
Inthe \ac{EU} region, it ranges from \SI{222}{\byte} for \ac{SF}7 to \SI{51}{\byte} for \ac{SF}12~\cite[p. 10f]{lora_alliance_inc_lorawan_regional_2017}.

\subsubsection{Correlation of \acs{SF} and \acs{SNR}}\label{sec:sf-snr-correlation}

\aclp{SF} are important for this thesis because they interact with the \ac{SNR} values of a transmission.
Higher \ac{SF} values allow for lower \ac{SNR} values (more noise, less signal) to still be decodable, since the wider spread of the signal makes it more resilient to noise.

\ac{SNR} was a value that was considered to be used in the fingerprinting approach.
Because of the correlation between \acl{SF} and \acl{SNR}, it is important to use both in conjunction.

\subsection{Why use \acs{LoRa}?}

As can be seen in \cref{pic:wireless-protocols-comparison}, \ac{LoRa} is a good choice for devices that need to be able to operate battery-powered in remote locations for extended periods of time, as it has a long range and low power consumption.

A \ac{LoRa} node that transmits \SI{75}{\byte} of payload data every 2 hours can theoretically last up to 10 years on a single 1000 mAh battery~\cite{cheong_comparison_2017}.

\emph{LoRa Energy Calculator} is a web application that can be used to roughly calculate the battery life of a \ac{LoRa} device by entering data such as payload size, data transmission periodicity and the battery type used~\cite{dramco_research_group_lora_2023}.
It calculates a ``worst case'' battery life of 6 years, 2 months and 1 week for a configuration with a payload size of 8 bytes, 1 hour of periodicity and a 2500 mAh AA type battery.
The ``best case'' scenario is rated at 17 years, 4 months and 1 week.
Best and worst case scenarios use different \aclp{SF} and \ac{TP} and also consider when the message is acknowledged (RX1 or RX2 window, explained later in \cref{sec:device-classes}).

\section{\acf{WAN}}

A \ac{WAN}, compared to a \acf{LAN} or \acf{MAN}, is a network that usually is not limited to one certain place, but connects multiple locations, across countries and continents~\cite[p. 2]{sadiku_fundamentals_2022}.
A well-known example of a \ac{WAN} is the Internet.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{pictures/lorawan-structure/wan_diagram.png}
    \caption{
        An example connection between multiple \acfp{LAN} and \acfp{MAN} using a \acf{WAN} as a diagram.\protect\cite{sadiku_fundamentals_2022}
    }\label{pic:wan-diagram}
\end{figure}

\Cref{pic:wan-diagram} shows the connections between \acfp{LAN}, \acfp{MAN} and \acfp{WAN}.
\acp{WAN} consist of various \acp{MAN}.
\acp{MAN}, in turn, consist of various \acp{LAN}.

\subsection{\acf{LPWAN}}

While most \acp{WAN}, such as the Internet, typically have a high bandwidth and low latency, \acp{LPWAN}, on the other hand are designed to have ``low duty cycles, very low data rates, relatively longer latencies, low power consumption, and coverage over several kilometers''~\cite[p. 289]{kumar_connecting_2023}.
These factors make them more suitable for handling large amounts of sensors and actors that only need to transmit small amounts of data infrequently over long distances.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{pictures/lorawan-structure/lpwan_network_structure.jpg}
    \caption{
        A simple diagram of a \ac{LPWAN} network structure.
        The connections between the entities can be seen.\protect\cite{fernandez_assessing_2020}
    }\label{pic:lpwan-diagram}
\end{figure}

\Cref{pic:lpwan-diagram} shows the structure of a \ac{LPWAN} network.
Multiple \ac{IoT} devices connect to gateways or base stations.
Those gateways are in turn connected to the internet or a larger network via a backhaul connection in order to enable communication between end devices.

\section{\acf{LoRaWAN}}\label{sec:lorawan}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.3\textwidth]{pictures/logos/LoRaWAN_Logo.eps}
    \caption{
        \ac{LoRaWAN} logo~\protect\cite{lora_alliance_francais_2022}
    }
\end{figure}

\ac{LoRaWAN} uses the \ac{LoRa} wireless communication protocol to create a \ac{LPWAN} where multiple devices can communicate with each other over long distances.
It defines a secure way to transfer packets from the end devices to \acp{AS} by enforcing \ac{E2EE}.
This section will explain the structure of a \ac{LoRaWAN} network and how it works.

\subsection{\acs{LoRaWAN} network architecture}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{pictures/lorawan-structure/lorawan-architecture.png}
    \caption{
        The structure of a \ac{LoRaWAN} network.~\protect\cite{the_things_industries_bv_lorawan_nodate}
    }\label{pic:lorawan-network-structure}
\end{figure}

The \ac{LoRaWAN} network architecture, as seen in \cref{pic:lorawan-network-structure} consists of four main components~\cite[p. 8]{lora_alliance_inc_lorawan_specification_2017}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The end nodes (called end devices during this thesis),
    \item the gateways (also called concentrators or base stations),
    \item the \acf{LNS}, and
    \item the \acfp{AS}.
\end{itemize}

\ac{LoRaWAN} data rates typically range from 0.3 kbps to 50 kbps, depending on the region and the \ac{LoRa} modulation used~\cite[p. 8]{lora_alliance_inc_lorawan_specification_2017}.

\subsection{Gateways}\label{sec:gateways}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{pictures/hardware/gateways/mikrotik-lr8-kit.png}
    \caption{
        A MikroTik wAP LR8 kit \ac{LoRaWAN} Gateway.
        This was one of the gateways used during this thesis.~\protect\cite{the_things_industries_bv_lorawan_nodate}
    }\label{pic:mikrotik-lr8-kit-gateway}
\end{figure}

A \ac{LoRaWAN} gateway is a device that receives \ac{LoRa} packets (usually from \ac{LoRaWAN} devices) and forwards them to \ac{LNS}.

\ac{LoRa} gateways are usually based on a \ac{LoRa} concentrator, which is a \ac{RF} module that receives \ac{LoRa} packets and forwards them to the gateway's \ac{CPU} using a serial interface.
The \ac{CPU} processes the incoming data and, if desired forwards the packets to a \ac{LNS}, making the device a \ac{LoRaWAN} gateway.

To achieve the connection to the \ac{LoRaWAN} server, the gateway needs to be connected to the internet.
This connection is also called \emph{backhaul}.
The most widely used methods to realize this are Ethernet/\ac{LAN}, Wi-Fi and \ac{LTE} connections~\cite{the_things_industries_bv_lorawan_nodate}.

One example of a gateway used during this thesis and therein installed in Furtwangen is the \emph{MikroTik wAP LR8 kit}, as seen in \cref{pic:mikrotik-lr8-kit-gateway}.
This gateway is specified as suitable for outdoor usage, making it a good choice for the deployment in Furtwangen on top of (among others) the roof of the \acf{GHB}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{pictures/hardware/gateway-deployment/mikrotik-antenna-c-building.jpg}
    \caption{
        A MikroTik antenna installed on top of the \ac{HFU} C building.
        The exposed position of the roof in the valley where Furtwangen is located can be seen.
        In the background, on the right, the two buildings of the \acf{GHB} are visible.
    }\label{pic:mikrotik-antenna-c-building}
\end{figure}

While such gateways sometimes have a built-in antenna, the range of these antennas is only sufficient to cover small to medium-sized buildings or areas.
It is also possible to use external antennas if it is necessary to cover a much larger area as was the case in this thesis since a medium to long range localization of \ac{LoRa} devices was the goal.
While there are many options for external antennas, in the case of the MikroTik gateway, the decision was made to also use the external \ac{LoRa} antenna supplied by MikroTik, as it is specifically designed for the MikroTik gateway and thus should be a good match.
The deployment of this antenna on top of the \ac{HFU} C building is shown in \cref{pic:mikrotik-antenna-c-building}.

\subsection{Data Transmission}

In LoRaWAN, data transmissions from the end devices to the server and vice versa are called \emph{uplink} and \emph{downlink}, respectively~\cite[p. 12]{lora_alliance_inc_lorawan_specification_2017}.

Uplinks are relayed to the \ac{LNS} by one or more gateways from the end device.
Downlinks, on the other hand, are only sent from the \ac{LNS} to the end device using a single gateway~\cite[p. 12]{lora_alliance_inc_lorawan_specification_2017}.

\subsection{Device Classes}\label{sec:device-classes}

\ac{LoRaWAN} defines three classes of devices that offer different trade-offs between power consumption and availability~\cite[p. 10]{lora_alliance_inc_lorawan_specification_2017}.

\subsubsection{Class A}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{pictures/device-classes/class-a.png}
    \caption{
        A schema of a \ac{LoRaWAN} Class A device communication.
        The two receive windows (RX1 and RX2) are visible.~\protect\cite{the_things_industries_bv_device_nodate}
    }\label{pic:lorawan-device-class-a-schema}
\end{figure}

Class A is used for devices that need to consume as little power as possible.
Every \ac{LoRaWAN} device must support at least the Class A mode~\cite[p. 11]{lora_alliance_inc_lorawan_specification_2017}.
A communication in Class A is always initiated by the end device itself.

Bidirectional communication is possible in Class A through the use of two downlink receive windows during which it is possible for the \ac{LNS} to send data to the device~\cite[p. 13]{lora_alliance_inc_lorawan_specification_2017}.
An example can be seen in \cref{pic:lorawan-device-class-a-schema}.

Class A consumes the least amount of power of the three classes, because the devices themselves may specify when and how often they want to communicate with the \ac{LNS}.
However, this also makes it impossible for the \ac{LNS} to send data to the device at any other time.

\subsubsection{Class B}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{pictures/device-classes/class-b.png}
    \caption{
        A schema of a \ac{LoRaWAN} Class B device communication.
        The additional ping slots where the end device is reachable by gateways can be seen.~\protect\cite{the_things_industries_bv_device_nodate}
    }\label{pic:lorawan-device-class-b-schema}
\end{figure}

In addition to Class A, Class B devices are also able to receive downlink messages from the \ac{LNS} during dedicated downlink receive windows~\cite[p. 67]{lora_alliance_inc_lorawan_specification_2017}.
In order to realize this without the need for a per-device \ac{RTC}, Class B devices receive time synchronized beacons from the gateways.
The communication schema for Class B devices can be seen in \cref{pic:lorawan-device-class-b-schema}.

These scheduled downlink windows result in a higher power consumption for Class B devices, since those need to be awake during these windows.

\subsubsection{Class C}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{pictures/device-classes/class-c.png}
    \caption{
        A schema of a \ac{LoRaWAN} Class C device communication.
        The RX2 window is kept open between uplink transmissions to allow gateways to reach the end device at any time while no uplinks are occurring.~\protect\cite{the_things_industries_bv_device_nodate}
    }\label{pic:lorawan-device-class-c-schema}
\end{figure}

Class C devices, when not currently transmitting an uplink message, are always listening for downlink messages from the \ac{LNS}~\cite[p. 86]{lora_alliance_inc_lorawan_specification_2017}.
In essence, they keep the downlink windows as specified in Class B open all the time as seen in \cref{pic:lorawan-device-class-c-schema}.

As a result, Class C devices consume the most power because they are always listening for downlink messages.
The fact that they are always reachable by the \ac{LNS} also makes them the most suitable for applications that require a high data rate or reliable downlink accessibility.

\subsubsection{Conclusion}

As far as this thesis was concerned, only Class A devices were used.
This is because Class B and C use significantly more power than Class A because they keep their radio on for extended periods of time, which drains power quickly for battery-powered devices.

In their paper ``Comparison of LoRaWAN Classes and their Power Consumption'', Cheong et al.\ show that a device in Class C would need a battery around 19 times larger than a Class A device to achieve the same battery life with a packet size of 115 bytes and a transmission interval of 1 hour~\cite{cheong_comparison_2017}.
As mobile devices that have the need to be located are usually battery-powered, Class A is the most viable option for them.

The geolocation methods evaluated in this thesis work with any \ac{LoRaWAN} device Class.
While using Class C would mean that devices could actually be asked directly for their location, using Class A devices is usually the better choice due to the lower power consumption.

\subsection{Data security}

The security of the data sent is a major concern when talking about \ac{IoT} protocols.
\ac{LoRaWAN} uses \ac{AES} based \acf{E2EE}.
Each end device usually has a unique 128-bit \ac{AES} key that is used to encrypt the payload~\cite[p. 24]{lora_alliance_inc_lorawan_specification_2017}.

This \ac{E2EE} also makes \ac{LoRaWAN} packets secure against replay attacks (where a malicious attacker captures sent packets and sends them again), since a so-called \ac{MIC} is determined from the frame data.
This \ac{MIC} in turn contains a \emph{FCntUp} for uplinks and \emph{FCntDown} for downlinks, numbers that are incremented with each packet sent and are also encrypted along with the payload~\cite[p. 22f.]{lora_alliance_inc_lorawan_specification_2017}.

\section{\acf{TTN}}

\ac{TTN} provides a free to use \ac{SaaS} \ac{LNS} that has a global community of people building \ac{LoRaWAN} applications.
Its source code, named \ac{TTS}, is also available on GitHub under the Apache 2.0 license~\cite{the_things_network_thethingsnetworklorawan-stack_2023}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth]{pictures/logos/TTN-logo.eps}
    \caption{\acf{TTN} logo~\protect\cite{the_things_industries_bv_quick_nodate}}
\end{figure}


While it is officially called \emph{\acl{TTS} Community Edition} since 2021, it is still commonly referred to as \acf{TTN} by the community itself~\cite{the_things_industries_bv_what_2022}.
Its users provide \ac{TTN} with gateways that other users can use, making it a decentralized and crowdsourced \ac{LoRaWAN} network.

\subsection{Receiving packets from \acs{LoRaWAN} Gateways}

Gateways can forward \ac{LoRaWAN} packets that they receive to the \ac{LNS} in two commonly used ways.
This section will explain both of them.

\subsubsection{\acf{SUPF}}

The \ac{SUPF} is a piece of software used to connect \ac{LoRa} gateways to the \ac{LNS}~\cite{the_things_industries_bv_semtech_2022}.
The \ac{SUPF} forwards \ac{LoRaWAN} packets that it receives from its connected \ac{LoRa} concentrator to the \ac{LNS} using the \ac{UDP} protocol.

It can be configured using JSON files such as \lstinline{global_conf.json} and \lstinline{local_conf.json}.

\ac{TTN} marked the \acl{SUPF} as deprecated, since it ``has many security and scalability drawbacks``.
It is recommended to use the \ac{LBS} protocol instead~\cite{the_things_industries_bv_semtech_2022}.

\subsubsection{\acf{LBS}}\label{sec:lorawan-lbs}

Since \ac{TTN} v3, using the \ac{TCP}-based \acl{LBS} protocol is recommended over the \ac{SUPF} to connect gateways to the \ac{LNS}~\cite{the_things_industries_bv_semtech_2022}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{pictures/lorawan-structure/lora-basics-station-structure.png}
    \caption{
        A schema of communications from a gateway and a \ac{LNS} using \acf{LBS}.
        The \ac{CUPS} service can be seen in the top right.~\protect\cite{semtech_lora_developer_portal_lora_2022}
    }\label{pic:lora-basics-station-schema}
\end{figure}

\ac{LBS} uses \ac{TLS}-encrypted \ac{TCP} connections with token-based authentication to relay \ac{LoRaWAN} packets to the \ac{LNS}~\cite{the_things_industries_bv_lora_2022}.

The two main components of \acl{LBS} are the \ac{LNS} connection itself as well as the \acf{CUPS}.
The communication schema can be seen in \cref{pic:lora-basics-station-schema}.

The \ac{LNS} uses the \ac{WSS} protocol for communication and is responsible for handling the \ac{LoRaWAN} packets whereas the \acl{CUPS} is responsible for handling the configuration of the gateways.

While \ac{CUPS} is not strictly necessary for sending actual \ac{LoRaWAN} packets, it simplifies the management of gateways and their configuration.
It communicates using \ac{TLS}-encrypted \ac{TCP} (\ac{HTTPS}) connections with token-based authentication.
When a gateway is configured with \ac{CUPS}, it automatically receives its configuration from the \ac{LNS} and is authenticated to work with it.
\ac{CUPS} also allows for remote configuration of gateways as well as remote firmware updates~\cite{the_things_industries_bv_lora_2022}.

\subsubsection{Conclusion}

Some of the gateways used in this thesis were unable to use the more modern \acl{LBS} protocol.
This is especially true for the MikroTik LR8 wAP gateway, whose \ac{OS} \emph{RouterOS} hadn't been updated to enable using \ac{LBS} at the time of writing this thesis.
It therefore uses the \ac{SUPF} to forward \ac{LoRaWAN} packets to the \ac{LNS}.

Most of the other gateways deployed during this thesis, especially the ones from \emph{Dragino}, were able to use \ac{LBS} and therefore used it to forward \ac{LoRaWAN} packets to the \ac{LNS} in a more secure way as explained in \cref{sec:lorawan-lbs}.

\subsection{\acs{TTN} Console --- Device/Gateway Management}\label{sec:web-interface-and-device-gateway-management}

\ac{TTN} provides a web interface for managing devices and gateways that are registered to the network by the logged-in user.
It also provides a \ac{REST} \ac{API} for managing devices and gateways programmatically.

End devices are grouped into \emph{applications} that can be used to manage \ac{LoRaWAN} end devices that belong to a bigger project or device group.

In this thesis, an application was used to group the \ac{LoRaWAN} \ac{GPS} trackers that were used for data collection.

\subsection{Forwarding data from \acs{TTN} to \aclp{AS}}\label{sec:forwarding-data-from-ttn-to-as}

To transmit data from \ac{TTN} to an \ac{AS}, \ac{TTN} provides integrations~\cite{the_things_network_integrations_2021}.
\ac{TTN} offers several integrations for different cloud \acp{AS} such as \ac{AWS} IoT Core and Microsoft Azure IoT Hub.
It also provides a generic \ac{HTTP} webhook integration that can be used to forward data to any \ac{HTTP} or \ac{HTTPS} endpoint.

Additionally, \ac{TTN} provides a MQTT integration, which can send data to an MQTT broker.
MQTT is a widely used lightweight publish-subscribe messaging protocol that is often used in \ac{IoT} applications~\cite{mqtt_mqtt_2022}.
The MQTT protocol is not used in this thesis, so it will not be discussed further.

\ac{TTNM}, the service that was used to collect geolocation data from \ac{LoRaWAN} devices in this thesis, uses a webhook integration to collect data from \ac{TTN}.
This is explained in more detail in \cref{sec:ttm-data-collection}.

Integrations are usually managed on a per-application basis.
This means that different integrations can be used for different applications.

\subsection{Alternatives to \acf{TTN}}

While anyone can use the public \ac{SaaS} version of \ac{TTN} for free, it is not the only \ac{LNS} available.
\ac{TTN} can also be self-hosted, for example using Docker, using the open source \ac{LNS} \emph{The Things Stack}~\cite{the_things_network_host_2023}.

There are also several other \acp{LNS} that can be used to build a private \ac{LoRaWAN} network.

\emph{LORIOT} has a public community instance that acts similar to the \ac{SaaS} version of \ac{TTN}, and it also offers a self-hosted version~\cite{loriot_ag_loriot_2023}.
It is, contrary to \ac{TTN}, not open source.

Another popular \ac{LNS} is \emph{ChirpStack}, which is open source and can be self-hosted~\cite{chirpstack_chirpstack_2023}.
Contrary to \ac{TTN}, it is not a \ac{SaaS} and does not offer a public community instance.

\section{\acf{TTNM}}

\acf{TTNM} was created by engineer JP Meijers in 2015~\cite{linkedin_23_nodate}.
He first created it as a personal project to map the range of his own \ac{LoRaWAN} gateway.
However, the project has since been expanded to map the coverage of all public gateways registered in the public \ac{TTN} network instance~\cite{the_things_network_jp_2018}.
At the time of writing, this includes over 11,000 gateways.
This number was taken from the response of a \ac{TTN} \ac{API} route that \ac{TTNM} uses to display gateway data.

\subsection{Data collection}\label{sec:ttm-data-collection}

\acl{TTNM} works by using \ac{LoRaWAN} devices with \ac{GPS} modules that send their location to the \ac{TTN} network via uplink messages.
Alongside the location information, those devices' messages that are processed by \ac{TTN} also include information about which gateways received them.

Hence, \acl{TTNM} can use the information about which gateways received the message and the location information of the devices' \ac{GPS} modules.
This is done by means of a \emph{webhook} that sends the data to an endpoint of the \acl{TTNM} \ac{API} whenever a node sends a message to the \ac{TTN} network as has been explained in \cref{sec:forwarding-data-from-ttn-to-as}.
With this data, it can build a map displaying the coverage of \ac{LoRaWAN} gateways in the \ac{TTN} network.

\subsection{Frontend data views}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{pictures/ttn-mapper/heatmap_with_gateways.png}
    \caption{
        A screenshot of \ac{TTNM}'s \emph{heatmap} view of the Furtwangen area.
        The heatmap shows places where strong signals from \ac{LoRaWAN} gateways were recorded in reddish colors.
        Weaker signals are shown in blueish colors.
        Some gateways are visible as small blue and white circles.
        This screenshot was taken at a time when there were already several instances of data collection.
        \Cref{sec:collected-data-in-furtwangen-on-ttnm} will show before and after images of the same heatmap view for comparison.~\protect\cite{ttn_mapper_ttn_2023}
    }\label{pic:ttn-mapper-heatmap-with-gateways}
\end{figure}

\Cref{pic:ttn-mapper-heatmap-with-gateways} shows a screenshot of \acl{TTNM}'s heatmap view.
This page displays an interactive world map with a heatmap overlay.
It shows the coverage of \ac{LoRaWAN} gateways in the \ac{TTN} network by using and aggregating data that has been collected over the lifetime of the service.
Additionally, any gateway that has received at least one message from a \ac{GPS}-enabled \ac{LoRaWAN} node and has its location accessible from \ac{TTN} is displayed on the map.

Notably, blank spots on the map do not necessarily mean that there is no coverage in that area.
It can also mean that there haven't been any \ac{GPS}-enabled \ac{LoRaWAN} nodes that send their data to \ac{TTNM} in that area yet.

\subsection{Data access}

As far as this thesis is concerned, \acl{TTNM} provides a way to access \ac{RSSI} and geolocation data points for measurements done by \ac{GPS}-enabled \ac{LoRaWAN} devices.

\ac{TTNM} provides a (partially) open \ac{REST} \ac{API} that can be used to access the data that has been collected by it.
Data can be requested based on the end device that sent the message or the gateway that received it.
In addition, the data can be filtered by the time that it was recorded on.
The data is provided in graphical (map-based) form as well as in \ac{CSV} files.

There is an additional non-documented part of the \ac{API} that can be used to access the data in \ac{JSON} form.
This was the part of the \ac{API} that was used most for this thesis.

\subsection{Importance for this thesis}\label{sec:ttn-mapper-importance}

The data that is provided via the \ac{TTNM} \ac{REST} \ac{API} was the core of this thesis.
The \ac{TTNL} application that will be described in \cref{section:ttnl} was created to access this \ac{API} and request its data to make it possible to perform advanced queries on it.
Such queries were not possible with the \ac{TTNM} \ac{API} alone, since it doesn't provide direct access to its underlying \ac{DB} or provide specific endpoints for the kind of data filtering that was needed for this thesis.

Through building a \ac{DB} of \ac{RSSI} and location values, \ac{TTNM} also enables the use of the fingerprinting localization technique, as will be explained in \cref{sec:rssi-fingerprinting}.
This was one of the techniques used to locate devices in this thesis.

\section{Multilateration}\label{sec:multilateration-basics}

In everyday language, people often use the term \emph{triangulation} or when talking about the process of determining the location of a device based on the distance to multiple other devices.
However, triangulation uses the angles between the end device and three reference points to determine the location of the device, hence its name~\cite{yaro_multiangulation_2017}.
This process requires the end device to be able to determine the angles to the reference points, which is needs specific hardware.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{pictures/multilateration/gps_multilateration.png}
    \caption{
        An example of how multilateration works in \ac{GNSS} in 2D and 3D~\protect\cite{gisgeography_how_2018}.
        It can be seen that 4 Satellites are needed to get a three-dimensional fix while only 3 are needed for a two-dimensional fix.
    }\label{pic:multilateration-gps-2d-3d-example}
\end{figure}

The correct term to use when using distances between an end device and multiple receivers to achieve a localization of the end device is \emph{multilateration}.
An example of this in \ac{GNSS} is shown in \cref{pic:multilateration-gps-2d-3d-example}.
A specific case of multilateration is \emph{trilateration}, which specifies three receivers to get the ranges from~\cite{ruiz_efficient_2013}.

\section{\acf{GNSS}}

\ac{GNSS} is a generic term for systems that use satellites orbiting the Earth to determine the location of a device.
In everyday language, the term \ac{GPS} is often used as a synonym for \ac{GNSS}.
However, \ac{GPS} is only one of the several \ac{GNSS} systems that are currently in use.
\ac{GNSS} systems use multilateration to determine the location of end devices as explained in \cref{sec:multilateration-basics}.
\Cref{pic:multilateration-gps-2d-3d-example} shows an example of how this works with \ac{GNSS} satellites in 2D and 3D.
To determine the distance from the end device to the satellites, the time it takes for a signal to travel from the satellite to the end device is measured.
This approach is called \acf{ToA}.

\subsection{\acf{GPS}}

\ac{GPS} is the \ac{GNSS} system that is operated by the United States of America and is correctly named \emph{NAVSTAR \ac{GPS}}~\cite{department_of_defense_usa_gps_2020}.
The version of GPS the public has access to is called \acf{SPS}.
Additionally, there is the \acf{PPS} that is only available to the military and other authorized users~\cite{department_of_defense_usa_gps_2007}.

Using an iPhone 6, Merry and Bettinger measured the accuracy of \ac{GPS} to be between 7 and 13 meters in an urban environment~\cite{merry_smartphone_2019}.

\subsection{Other \acs{GNSS} systems}

There are several other \ac{GNSS} systems in use or in development by different countries.
For example, the Russian \acf{GLONASS}, the European \acf{Galileo}, the Chinese \acf{BDS}, and the Indian \acf{IRNSS}.

Most modern user devices such as smartphones support multiple \ac{GNSS} systems to improve the accuracy of the location determination.
For example, one of Samsung's most recent devices as of writing this thesis, the Galaxy S23 Ultra, supports \ac{GPS}, \ac{GLONASS}, \ac{Galileo}, and \ac{BDS}~\cite{gsmarena_samsung_2023}.

The \ac{LoRaWAN} devices used in this thesis, as described in \cref{subsec:used-lora-devices}, only use \ac{GPS} to determine their location.

\subsection{\acf{HDOP}}

When talking about how accurate a certain data point of a \ac{GNSS} system is, the term \ac{HDOP} is used regularly.
In fact, there are multiple different terms that can be used to describe such accuracies: \ac{HDOP}, \ac{PDOP}, \ac{VDOP}, \ac{TDOP}, and \ac{GDOP}~\cite{langley_dilution_1999}.
As far as two-dimensional positioning is concerned, \ac{PDOP} and \ac{HDOP} are relevant.

\ac{PDOP} is calculated by using the position of satellites as well as the position of the end device.
For example, ``on a 24-satellite constellation […], a 5-degree satellite elevation mask angle with no obstructions, and at least four satellites in view [results in a] \acf{PDOP} of six or lower''~\cite{langley_dilution_1999}.
In a sense, \ac{PDOP} is a measure of the quality of the current \ac{GNSS} constellation for a user.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{pictures/multilateration/Geometric_Dilution_Of_Precision.eps}
    \caption{
        Examples for different kinds of \ac{HDOP} values.
        A shows a (unrealistic) perfect example where there are no error margins --- a theoretical \ac{HDOP} of 0.
        B shows an example with error margins but a low \ac{HDOP}.
        The intersection area between the two annuli is small, therefore the error margin is small.
        C shows an example with a high \ac{HDOP}.
        The intersection area between the two annuli is large, therefore the error margin is large.\cite{xoneca_english_2013}
    }\label{pic:hdop-example-diagram}
\end{figure}

\ac{HDOP}, on the other hand, is a measure of the quality of a two-dimensional fix.
\Cref{pic:hdop-example-diagram} shows three examples of different \ac{HDOP} scenarios.

The \ac{HDOP} value is relevant to this thesis because it is included in the \ac{GPS} tracker \ac{LoRaWAN} packets sent to \ac{TTN}.
Thus, it was used to filter out values that were not considered accurate enough to be used in the evaluation.
As mentioned in \cref{subsec:cleaning-collected-data}, \ac{TTNM} also excludes certain data points based on the \ac{HDOP} value.

\subsection{Power usage}\label{subsec:gnss-power-usage}

In order to show the relevance of using \ac{RSS} values over \ac{GNSS} systems to locate end devices, this section will give a brief comparison of power consumption between the two.
The \emph{ELV-LW-GPS1} module is a \ac{GPS} tracker that was used for data collection during this thesis.
It will be evaluated in more detail in \cref{subsubsec:elv-gps-tracker-implementation}.

As it is considerably well-documented on the manufacturer's website, it will be used to calculate some power usage values.
The \emph{ELV-LW-GPS1} uses a \emph{Quectel LC86L} \ac{GNSS} chip as well as a \emph{dnt-TRX-ST1} \ac{LoRaWAN} module~\cite{elv_elektronik_ag_elv_2023}.

The \emph{LC86L} module uses \SI{32}{\milli\ampere} during \ac{GNSS} acquisition and has a \ac{TTFF} of \SI{35}{\second}~\cite{quectel_gnss_nodate}.
This is during a cold start of the chip, which is often used for \ac{LoRaWAN} \ac{GNSS} trackers to save power.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:LC86L-fix-consumption}
    mAh_{GPS\,Fix} = \SI{32}{\milli\ampere} \cdot \frac{\SI{35}{\second}}{3600} \approx \SI{0.311}{\milli\ampere\hour}
\end{equation}

\Cref{eq:LC86L-fix-consumption} shows the power usage of the \emph{LC86L} module during a single \ac{GPS} acquisition.

While the \emph{dnt-TRX-ST1} has a similar power usage of \SI{29}{\milli\ampere} during transmission of \ac{LoRaWAN} packets, it takes a considerably shorter amount of time to transmit a \ac{LoRa} packet than it takes to acquire a \ac{GNSS} fix.
For example, when the \emph{ELV-LW-GPS1} module transmits one of its \ac{GPS} location data packets using \ac{SF}9, it uses only \SI{0.246784}{\second} of airtime, according to \ac{TTN}.
The same airtime value can also be calculated using a tool called \emph{\ac{LoRaWAN} airtime calculator} with 18 input bytes, a \ac{SF} of 9, the EU868 region and a bandwidth of \SI{125}{\kilo\hertz}~\cite{the_things_network_lorawan_nodate}.
This transmission time can become even shorter when using a lower \ac{SF} or when fewer bytes are transmitted.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:dnt-TRX-ST1-tx-consumption}
    mAh_{\ac{LoRa}\,TX} = \SI{29}{\milli\ampere} \cdot \frac{\SI{0.246784}{\second}}{3600} \approx \SI{0.00198}{\milli\ampere\hour}
\end{equation}

\Cref{eq:dnt-TRX-ST1-tx-consumption} shows the power usage of the \emph{dnt-TRX-ST1} module during a single \ac{LoRa} transmission.

Because both modules operate at or around \SI{3.3}{\volt}, the power usages in \si{\milli\ampere\hour} are comparable.
This means that acquiring a \ac{GNSS} fix with the \emph{ELV-LW-GPS1} module uses approximately \SI{157}{\times} more power than transmitting a \ac{LoRa} packet with the same module.
This comparison does not take into account the power consumption of the other components of the \emph{ELV-LW-GPS1} module.
However, it still shows the dimensions of the difference in power consumption between \ac{GPS} and \ac{LoRaWAN} \ac{RSS} localization.

\section{Localization techniques for usage with \acs{LoRaWAN}}\label{sec:lorawan-localization-techniques}

This section will explain several concepts relating to geolocation in conjunction with \ac{LoRaWAN} using different variables.

\subsection{Multilateration}\label{sec:lorawan-multilateration}

As explained in \cref{sec:multilateration-basics}, multilateration uses the distance between a device and multiple receivers to determine the location of the end device.
However, while the theoretical concept of multilateration, as shown in \cref{pic:multilateration-gps-2d-3d-example} is simple, there are several challenges when applying it to real-world scenarios.
Distances measured between devices are often not accurate enough to determine the location of a device accurately.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{pictures/multilateration/multilateration_error_ranges.png}
    \caption{
        An example of multilateration in 2D with error ranges.
        In contrast to the example shown in \cref{pic:multilateration-gps-2d-3d-example}, the margins of error can be seen as well as the non-definite margin of error around the estimated device position~\protect\cite{kapoor_novel_2016}.
    }\label{pic:multilateration-with-error-ranges-example}
\end{figure}

When dealing with such inaccuracies, the calculated position of the device often is calculated as not a single point but a range of possible positions.

\Cref{pic:multilateration-with-error-ranges-example} shows an example of this in 2D where the device's position is estimated to be in the area where the three annuli (circles/``donuts'') overlap.
This does not result in a definite position of the device but rather a range of possible positions.
The size of this estimated localization range depends on the accuracy of the distance measurements.

The following sections will explain different methods of determining the distance between a device and a receiver.
As was mentioned just now, the accuracy of these distance measurements is crucial for the accuracy of the actual localization.

\subsubsection{\acf{ToA} based multilateration}\label{sec:toa-based-multilateration}

The \acf{ToA} based method uses the difference in the signal's time of arrival at the receiving stations.
In conjunction with the speed of light ($299792458\ \mathrm{m/s}$), this time difference can be used to calculate the distance between the receiving stations and the transmitting station~\cite{khalaf-allah_time_2015}.

\ac{ToA} is being used by radio location systems like \ac{GPS} to determine the position of a device by using Multilateration~\cite{department_of_defense_usa_gps_2020}.
For GPS, usually four or more satellites are required to determine the position of a device accurately.

\ac{ToA} based multilateration requires the reference stations to be time-synchronized with each other in order to produce good results.
Since the speed of light is very high, small differences in time synchronization between the reference points can lead to large inaccuracies in the distance calculated between them.

\subsubsection{\acf{RSSI} based multilateration}\label{sec:rssi-based-multilateration}

This method uses the \acf{RSSI} values that were explained in \cref{sec:rssi} to determine the distance between sender and receiver.
The distance between sender and receiver usually decreases in correlation with the measured \ac{RSSI} value.
However, as was mentioned in \cref{sec:multipath-propagation}, the \ac{RSSI} value can be also affected by other factors like obstacles and the environment.

These facts make \ac{RSSI}-based localization only work accurately in environments with little to no obstacles and thus a low amount of multipath propagation.
\Cref{sec:rssi-based-multilateration-implementation} will describe how this method was implemented in two different forms in this thesis.

\subsection{\acs{RSSI} Fingerprinting}\label{sec:rssi-fingerprinting}

Another method to locate devices is called fingerprinting~\cite{xia_indoor_2017}.
It uses a set of known device locations with their corresponding \ac{RSS} values to locate devices based on the \ac{RSS} values it receives from the surrounding receivers --- \ac{LoRaWAN} gateways, in this case.
The combination of an \ac{RSSI} value and the corresponding location is called a fingerprint.

When a new set of \ac{RSS} values is recorded by a device, its \ac{RSS} values are compared to the known \ac{DB} of known fingerprints.
The device's location can then be estimated by comparing the \ac{RSS} values to the known fingerprints.
If multiple fingerprints match the \ac{RSS} values, the device's location can be estimated by calculating the average or center of the locations of the matching fingerprints.

This thesis will explore the use of \ac{RSSI} fingerprinting for \ac{LoRaWAN} localization in \cref{sec:fingerprinting-implementation}.
While \ac{ML} approaches can be used to improve fingerprinting, they were not used in this work, only simpler similarity calculations.

Fortunately, building a \ac{DB} of fingerprints for the use case explored in this thesis is fairly straightforward, since the \ac{TTNM} \ac{API} already provides the necessary raw data, as mentioned in \cref{sec:ttn-mapper-importance}.
\Cref{sec:collecting-additional-ttnm-data} will explain the \ac{LoRaWAN} devices used to collect additional data for fingerprinting.

\subsubsection{Using additional values for fingerprinting}\label{sec:fingerprinting-additional-values}

In addition to the \ac{RSS} values, other values were used in this thesis in an attempt to improve the accuracy of fingerprinting.
These values are the \ac{SNR} and the \ac{SF} of the received packets.
They are recorded by \ac{TTN} in addition to the \ac{RSS} values for each gateway that received the packet, so it was simple to include them in the fingerprinting \ac{DB}.
Furthermore, \ac{TTNM} also has those additional parameters in its \ac{DB} that is accessible via the \ac{TTNM} \ac{API}.
